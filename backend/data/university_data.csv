University of Bologna,Italy,Bologna,65819.0,unibo.it,223,"Via Zamboni, 33",1088.0,"History and Identity
Alma Mater Studiorum: the first university in the Western world
The University of Bologna has ancient origins, and is considered to be the oldest university in the Western world. 1088 is the year in which by convention the University of Bologna is considered to have been founded, when law began to be taught freely in the city. Founded by students and for students, the Alma Mater Studiorum immediately attracted young scholars from all over Europe, bringing to life the ideal of the universality of knowledge and culture it still pursues today, also through its increasing focus on internationalisation.
The University of Bologna was home to illustrious students including Petrarca, Boccaccio and Dante Alighieri, and a laboratory for many famous academics studying in its different schools - from law to medicine, from the arts and philosophy to mathematics and science. Over the centuries it has developed to carve out and maintain a central role in forging knowledge for the society of the future. The University's key role in world culture was confirmed in 1988, on its nine hundredth anniversary, when the Rectors from 430 universities from every continent met in Bologna to undersign the Magna Charta Universitatum Europaeum, formally recognising the University of Bologna as the Alma Mater of all universities. The Magna Charta, currently signed by 752 Rectors from 81 countries, underlines the autonomy of universities and the essential link between teaching and research, transcending the limits imposed by “any geographical and political border”. Again, in 1999, in the University's Aula Magna, 29 European Ministers of higher education signed the Bologna Declaration which led to the start of an important – and ongoing - process to build the European Higher Education Area. The aim is to promote European Higher Education throughout the world, increasing competitiveness and international collaboration.
Today the Alma Mater is an autonomous, non-denominational, pluralistic public institution whose primary aims are research and teaching, indissoluble activities which pursue critical knowledge that is open to dialogue and interaction among cultures, respecting the freedom of science and teaching. The Alma Mater sets out to be a natural environment for knowledge, interpreting and orienting the transformations of its time, guaranteeing the processing, innovation, transfer and enhancement of knowledge for the advantage of both individuals and society as a whole.
Values and Future
Freedom, merit, excellence, internationalisation
The University of Bologna promotes and safeguards the respect for basic human rights, a primary value for the whole university community. The recognition of merit and the pursuit of excellence are priority criteria that guide the development strategies and choices of the Alma Mater.
Students enrolling at the University of Bologna have a wide range of choices, in terms of both study programmes and the choice of university campus. The Alma Mater has been a multicampus university since 1989, the Bologna campus working together with other campuses in Cesena, Forlì, Ravenna and Rimini. Each campus is an integral part of its host city, offering facilities and services which accompany students throughout their university life, not only in their studies but also in cultural activities, sports and other forms of associations.
The quality of teaching is closely linked to the quality of research, and research plays a key role in the future of new generations and society generally. This profound belief underlies all the activities of the Alma Mater, which also include the skilful sourcing and use of national and international funds and the creation of strategic alliances with both institutions and the business world.
At the University of Bologna, internationalisation has been considered a strategic tool for many years. Its international dimension lies in both its history and its vocation: the inauguration of the Studies Center in Buenos Aires in 1998 and, more generally, the opening of research and learning programmes to foreign countries, the establishment of and participation in international networks and consortia, both incoming and outgoing mobility for students and scholars (which places it at the top of the European league tables), demonstrate the University's ability to dialogue with the most qualified international scientific and cultural institutions.
The Alma Mater places great attention on its organisation and works to assure the constant improvement of its processes, welcoming the challenge of combining large numbers with quality.
A long-standing promoter of relations with civil society, the institutions and businesses, and a driving force in the economic and cultural growth of the territory it operates in, the University actively contributes to the well-being of society and the increased competitive performance of the production system of the whole country.
Teaching
Quality by vocation
The Alma Mater is a place where knowledge is processed, transmitted and learned. An educational vocation which, since its foundations, has led to the definition of learning pathways focusing on the acquisition of critical skills and methodological rigour using a multitude of methods and disciplines.
Today the University offers a wide and diversified, cosmopolitan and rigorous range of study programmes designed to promote students' personal, cultural and professional growth, through the transfer of the results of its research, also meeting the demands of a complex, open society.
More than 2,800 professors work with more than 87,000 students fromItalyand other countries: a community working together on degree programmes, first and second level Professional Master's, PhDs, specialisation schools, post-graduate and lifelong learning programmes and summer and winter schools.
Internationalisation is a quality feature of all teaching programmes at the Alma Mater, contributing to the promotion of positive encounters of people and ideas from all kinds of geographical origins and cultural backgrounds: of the more than 440 study opportunities, 49 are international programmes.
Teaching at the University of Bologna is supported by numerous international agreements: 169 bilateral and multilateral cooperation framework agreements signed with partner universities (mostly from outside of the EU), 214 specific (sectoral) cooperation agreements with partner universities at faculty or department level, 1,986 bilateral agreements with foreign universities under the Erasmus programme.
The quality of the University's Programme Catalogue, which is constantly monitored through student assessments, places Bologna among the top Italian universities in the national and international league tables. The Alma Mater is top of the 2010-2011 table drawn up by Censis-Repubblica and is the top-ranking Italian university in the world tables drawn up by QS World Ranking.
Students
At the heart of the Alma Mater system
The University of Bologna offers students a wide range of services to support and facilitate their entire study path and their overall personal growth throughout their university career.
For the Alma Mater, the right to study is a priority, and is guaranteed by actions offering financial support and incentives for merit-worthy students without their own means: these include the total or partial exemption from tuition fees, scholarships for studying in Italy and abroad, loans, collaborations within the university organisation, merit prizes and a range of other services dedicated to the students of the Alma Mater.
Students lie at the heart of the University organisation. Incoming, information and guidance services aim to promote the aware choice of study programmes, the regularity of university careers and a reduction in the number of drop-outs. Through computerised, flexible procedures accessible from different platforms, students at the Alma Mater are able to communicate easily with the university community, organising and managing their own study paths directly online. Accommodation, canteens, study facilities, libraries, health care and an office for the registration of rental contracts are available for students living outside the city. Every campus provides specific services for disabled and dyslexic students as well as psychological support services.
The University invests in a wide range of sports and language services, signing agreements with institutions in the city for subsidised cultural initiatives for students, and supports the activities of the student associations.
The focus on the needs of students as people, citizens and future professionals, as well as the creation, management and continuous monitoring of dedicated student services, as well as the quality of the teaching, have made the University of Bologna one of the most popular and well-attended in Italy, the most international of Italian universities, with efficiency indexes above the national average, and a valid, authoritative interlocutor for businesses and institutions, also for training courses and internships.
To facilitate entry into the labour market, the University has signed agreements with around 8,000 public and private businesses and institutions, around 100 of which are abroad. Finally, the success of the careers guidance policies is confirmed by the percentage of graduates, around 50%, who one year after completing their studies are in paid employment.
Research
Investing in young people for the common good
International, interdisciplinary excellence that focuses on the future. Research at the University of Bologna is above all this, thanks to its 3,000 Professors (full and associate) and researchers, more than 1,000 research fellows and scholarship holders, the PhD programmes, dedicated departments and services. In addition to this, investments are made in training that focuses on international research, support for basic research, a synergic network of relationships with the world of university research, the institutions and businesses.
For the Alma Mater, research is a fundamental lever for competitiveness and employment and its key role has been demonstrated by the many achievements over the years: around 13,000 products developed on average every year, 177 patents registered, 7 million Euros funded by the MIUR (Ministry of Education, Universities and Research) for the most recently approved PRIN (Research Projects of National Interest) and FIRB projects (Future in Research).
Within Europe, the University of Bologna stands out for the breadth of its competencies and its systematic policy of providing support services to researchers in their relations with Brussels and in the preparation of research projects. Within the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme, funding worth 60 million Euros has been obtained for 190 projects. Today the Alma Mater is the leading Italian university and the country's second organisation (after the National Research Council) for its ability to attract European funding for research (projects funded in the four-year period 2007-2010), and 27th in the European league tables.
One factor of excellence certainly lies in the multidisciplinarity of its research: the University has established 4 Integrated Research Teams (IRT) in fields of international research covering agri-food, the social economy and civil society, sciences and technologies for the cultural heritage and the integration of research skills in the Brazilian area and Latin America.
At the Alma Mater, research strongly focuses on international spheres while maintaining deep roots in the local community. The University takes part in the regional technological platforms through its 7 Interdepartmental Centres for Industrial Research. Projects run from agri-food to mechanics through to information technology, from materials and industrial ecodesign to energy safety and efficiency.
The University participates in the intra-regional PhD programme funded by the SPINNER consortium as well as advanced-level apprenticeship PhD programmes directly involving public and private enterprises.
For the Alma Mater, PhD studies, the third level of training laid down in the Bologna Declaration, are fundamental for its own growth and the development of all society, preparing young people for research, the creation of ideas and innovation.

Xi'an Jiaotong University,China,Xi'an,46730.0,xjtu.edu.cn,119,"No.28, Xianning West Road, Shanxi Province, China",1896.0,"XJTU is a key university which is directly administered by the Chinese Education Ministry and is one of the oldest current institutions of higher education in China. The predecessor of XJTU was Nanyang College, which was founded in 1896 in Shanghai and renamed Jiaotong University in 1921. In 1956, the main body of Jiaotong University was moved to Xi'an according to the decision issued by the State Council, and was formally named Xi'an Jiaotong University in 1959, which was listed as a national key university. Xi'an Jiaotong University, as one of the first universities entering the seventh and eighth five-plan, as well as China's ""211 Project"" and “985 Project”, is selected to be developed into a global first-class university. In April 2004, approved by the State Council, the original Xi'an Medical University and original Shaanxi Institute of Finance and Economics were integrated into Xi'an Jiaotong University.
Currently Xi'an Jiaotong University is a comprehensive research university with scientific focus. It is composed of 10 branches of learning, namely: science, engineering, medicine, economics, management, literature, law, philosophy, education and art. The university, currently, consists of 26 full-time colleges and schools, 8 schools for undergraduates and 12 affiliated teaching hospitals. XJTU boasts a high-level staff of 5,561, including 2,861 full-time teachers, among which are 1,700 professors and associated professors. XJTU has 25 academicians of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Chinese Academy of Engineering, of which 14 are doubled-hired academicians. There are 6 national-level teachers, 47 Changjiang Scholars, 34 Outstanding Young Investigator Award laureates, 16 national experts with outstanding contribution to the country, 23 nation-level candidates of the National Talents Project, and the 21st Century National Talents Project, 19 leaders of the Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team, 234 personnel of 21st Century Excellent Talents Training Plan proposed by the Ministry of Education, and 535 experts who have made outstanding contributions and enjoy special governmental allowances.
XJTU has a current enrollment of 30,682 full-time students, including over 14,697 masters and doctoral candidates. The university offers 84 undergraduate majors. It consists of 27 disciplines and 154 sub-disciplines authorized to confer PhD degrees and 45 disciplines and 242 sub-disciplines authorized to confer Master Degrees, and 22 centers to confer professional degrees. Among these, there are 8 nation-level key disciplines, 8 nation-level key sub-disciplines, 3 nation-level key sub-discipline pilot sites. In addition, 27 disciplines and 155 sub-disciplines are recognized as key disciplines at the provincial and ministerial level. It has 25 research facilities for post-doctoral students, 5 national key laboratories, 4 national engineering research centers and 59 key research centers and laboratories at the provincial and ministerial level.
During its more than 110 year history, Xi'an Jiaotong University has forged a set of principles to which it has remained true: devotion to learning makes the country stronger; creation grows out of hard work; honor rectitude and respect truth; learn teaching rigorously and the character of loving China and the university and bearing in mind where one's happiness comes from. The university also insists on the school-operational characteristic of having “a high staring point, a profound foundation, strict requirements and focusing on practice,” which continually carves out and innovates and diligently trains people. Among XJTU's outstanding alumni are Cai E, Huang Yanpei, Shao Lizi, Li Shutong, Ling Hongxun, Zou Taofen, Lu Dingyi, Hou Shaoqiu, Qian Xuesen, Wang An, Tian Binggeng, and Jiang Zemin. Over 200 XJTU alumni, including Mao Yisheng, Wu Youxun, Zhu Wuhua, Zhang Guangdou, Zhang Wei and Wu Wenjun, all of whom have been honored with membership in the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Engineering. Since moving to Xi'an over 50 years ago, XJTU has educated a large group of talented individuals in many fields, its graduates having achieved distinction in all walks of life.
In recent years, the university has been following a path of active exploration and bold innovation as it seeks to implement the national reform plan for the comprehensive restructuring of higher education. An important element of this reform is the new “2+4+X” model for research universities; a model which emphasizes providing the students with a solid foundation of general knowledge, sound research skills and the ability to innovate. The goal is to transform the university from one which simply transmits knowledge to one which emphasizes active engagement in research. In 2006, XJTU took the lead among Chinese universities when it undertook to create a system of residential colleges modeled on the traditional Chinese academy of learning. This twin college system is aimed at giving our students the best possible chance for success. In 2007, XJTU established the “Qian Xuesen Experimental Class” for particularly gifted students and the “Zonglian Experimental Class”, whose purpose is to develop an appropriate classroom model for medical education. The university also set up its “engineering workshop” to stimulate students’ interests in science and technology and to encourage innovation and creativity, in keeping with the adage that “small inventions lead to big creations.” In 2010, the university first Experimental Class for Talents of Basic Subject was started. As one of only two universities in China with a “class for gifted young people,” XJTU has received praise from students and parents alike for its unique educational model, its favorable study environment, excellent teachers and substantial teaching resources, and its positive good teaching results. So far, the university has received 60 national teaching awards. In addition, it currently has 34 national elite courses, 8 national–level teaching centers, and 9 national-level teaching teams. To date, 26 XJTU dissertations have been recipients of the annual award given to “China's 100 best doctoral dissertations”; another 40 have been nominated for that award.
Research in science and technology at XJTU is directed primarily at meeting the nation's most important needs, forging into international frontiers, contributing to autonomous creation and accelerate industrial application. To this end, XJTU is continually strengthening its capacity to innovate while seeking to raise its level of competitiveness. Since 2000, faculty members and researchers from XJTU have headed 13 projects under the 973 Program. In the same period, university scientists and engineers have had 1,489 projects approved by the National Natural Science Fund. Its total number of basic research projects and grants places XJTU in the front rank among Chinese universities. Since 2000, the university has been awarded 31 national science and technology prizes as the first author. To produce these results, the university relies on its strength in key disciplines and on its unique educational model, with its emphasis on the integration of production, study and research. In addition, it has, in cooperation with the government and with large and mid-sized enterprises, established research and development parks whose aim is to help solve the key technological problems facing industry and to strengthen the contributions of science and technology to the regional economy and of local social development.
Xi'an Jiaotong University has worked hard to create an environment conducive to “dynamic thinking, dynamic learning, and dynamic living.” It owns a national-level center for cultural education and boasts 203 student organizations. It sponsors a rich and varied set of activities in science and technology, literature and the arts, and sports. “Jiuzhou Experts,” “Discussing the World,” “Grand Schoolroom in Siyuan,” and “Study Forum” have become well-known venues in which students can expand their horizons.

Xi'an Jiaotong University has extensive ties with the world of international scholarship and research. Since 2000, 14 Nobel laureates, 1 Fields Prize winner and over 2,000 foreign professors have been invited to the campus to give lectures. Over 17,000 scholars, CEOs, and high-level government officials from around the world have been involved in exchanges or other kinds of collaborative activity with XJTU. More than 8,000 XJTU teachers and students have gone abroad to visit, study, do research, or participate in degree programs, and over 2,000 faculty members, and researchers have traveled abroad for conferences. The university has built inter-university cooperative relationships with 145 universities and research institutions in 42 countries and regions, including the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, New Zealand and Korea. Over 900 foreign experts have come to work at the university. In addition, there are currently 1,098 foreign students from over 86 countries studying at XJTU.
Xi'an Jiatong University, which is located in the city of Xi'an in Shaanxi province, has three campuses: the Xingqing campus, the Yanta campus and the Qujiang campus, covering a total area of 1.9894 million square meters. The total constructed area is 2.0385 million square meters. The “Qian Xuesen Library,” named after alumnus Qian Xuesen, which is authorized by the Propaganda Department of the CPC, and whose name was rendered by Jiang Zemin, is located on the Xingqing campus, covering nearly 40 thousand square meters and has 3,518 reading seats.

Its holdings now include 28,639 electronic periodicals in Chinese and foreign languages and more than one million electronic books and 1.07 million e-books and 15 kinds of world famous periodicals covering more than one hundred years. The library's computer system is fully integrated with the campus network, CERNET, and the Internet. On and off-campus users have access to the system via remote terminal or over the Internet. The university's computer network meets the highest international standards. Students are housed in modern dormitories and may choose from a wide variety of dishes in the university's extensive dining facilities. The Siyuan Student Activities Center, with a total area of over 10,000 square meters, is the venue for a variety of events, and the university's athletic fields and playgrounds are modernly equipped. The university has an extensive system of scholarships and stipends, with scholarships for undergraduates totaling 12 million Yuan per year, and additional annual support in the form of loans totaling 14.4 million Yuan. The university has also established an “innovation fund” to provide support for graduate students. Each year, it distributes about 50 million Yuan. The university has a modern psychological health education and counseling center for university students.
On June 5, 2009, Premier Wen Jiabao visited the university, meeting with teachers and students. Those present will always remember and cherish his words: “May one hundred-year old XJTU remain young and energetic forever!” XJTU alumnus Jiang Zemin has returned to his Alma Mater four times and has spoken of it with words of praise: “With its verdant pines and cypresses, and quiet beauty, the campus is the ideal place to study, the ideal environment to bring forth knowledge, wisdom and new scientists with new ideas.”
In this new century, Xi'an Jiaotong University continues to renew itself to adapt to the ever-changing landscape of higher education, domestically and internationally, gradually evolving a model of higher education that is suited to international developments, while constructing at the same time a modern scientific approach to policy-making, policy execution and supervision, so as to provide the university with a management structure meeting international standards. Together, the two lay a firm foundation for building Xi'an Jiaotong University into a top-flight international university.

University of Padova,Italy,Padova,45169.0,unipd.it,210,"via 8 Febbraio, 2 - 35122 ",1222.0,"Along with such universities as Bologna, Paris, Oxford and Cambridge, that of Padua was one of
the first to exemplify the idea of a Gymnasium Omnium Disciplinarum - an educational model
that can now be seen throughout the world. Though the university's year of foundation is
generally given as 1222, that in fact only marks the date from which there are records of a ""fixed
and publicly recognised university established within the city"" and so the actual foundation can
be dated even early, to a period when a number of professors and students had left the
University of Bologna as a result of ""offences to academic freedom and the failure to observe the
privileges that had been guaranteed to teachers and pupils"". Such exchanges of personnel and
students - together with the similarities in the Statutes of the two foundations - reveal that Padua
placed a certain importance on this link with what was the oldest university in the world, against
which it was however very soon setting itself up as a rival (and even centuries later that rivalry
has lost none of its edge).University of Padua was not founded as the result of a charter granted
by pope of emperor, but as a ""response to the specific social and cultural conditions that created
a need for it""; and its motto of Universa Universis Patavina Libertas was well-deserved not only
under the original Commune of the thirteenth century but also during the fourteenth-century
rule of the Carraresi and throughout the period of Venetian rule of the city (from the 15th to the
18th century), all these different authorities guaranteeing full respect for the university's
freedoms. The fifteenth century would see the beginning of more than three hundred years of
growth in prestige as the University of Padua benefited from the protection of the Venetian
2
Republic, which was determined that this should be the only Gymnasium Omnium Disciplinarum
within its territories. It was during this period that Padua made its great contribution to the
nascent scientific revolution, with developments in philosophical thought, in the study of
medicine and anatomy and the great discoveries in astronomy, physics and mathematics that are
linked with the eighteen-year period that Galileo Galilei taught at the university (from 1592 to
1610).During the seventeenth and eighteenth century, as universities spread throughout Europe
and ideas were exchanged backwards and forwards across the continent, the role of Padua
University changed; however, it still maintained its unique position within the Venetian Republic,
and the eminence of its professors meant it continued to hold a high place both within and
without Italy. Amongst the figures associated with the University at this time, one might mention:
Domenico Guglielmi, Bernardino Ramazzini, Gian Battista Morgagni, Gian Battista Poleni, Antonio
Vallisneri and Giuseppe Toaldo, with the students including Carlo Goldoni, Ugo Foscolo, Giuseppe
Tartini and Giacomo Casanova.The political role of the university was particularly apparent in the
nineteenth century, when its professors and students took part in the local uprising of February
1848 against the Austrian occupation; and again in the First World War, Padua would find itself
the centre of the zone of operations bordering on the Austrian Front. Just a few decades later,
under its Rector Concetto Marchesi and its Pro-Rector Egidio Meneghetti, Padua University would
live up to its motto by taking a leading role in the struggle against the Nazi occupation of 1943-45;
and in recognition of the sacrifices made by so many young people who lost their life in that
struggle, the university would later receive the Gold Medal for Valour, the only university in Italy
to gain such an awardn recent years, the University has been able to meet the problems posed by
overcrowded facilities by re-deploying over the Veneto as a whole. In 1990, the Institute of
Management Engineering was set up in Vicenza; then the summer courses at Bressanone began
once more; and in 1995 the Agripolis centre at Legnaro - for Agricultural Science and Veterinary
Medicine - opened. Other sites of re-deployment are at Rovigo, Treviso, Feltre, Castelfranco
Veneto, Conegliano, Chioggia and Asiago.Recent changes in state legislation have also opened the
way to greater autonomy for Italian universities, and in 1995 Padua adopted a Statute that gave it
greater independence. As the publications of innumerable conferences and congresses show, the
modern-day University of Padua plays an important role in scholarly and scientific research at
both a European and world level. True to its origins, this is the direction in which the Institution
intends to move in the future, establishing closer and closer links of co-operation and exchange
with all the world's major research universities.",36058.0,14594.0,1806.0,45.416668,11.883333,https://www.shanghairanking.cn/_uni/logo/290d176ce.png

UC has been named a “green university” by Princeton Review, which also ranked UC among the top 20 universities in the nation for the diversity of the student population. G.I. Jobs lists UC among America’s “military-friendly” campuses for its efforts on behalf of veterans.
In 2013, UC and its affiliates earned more than $400 million in grants and contracts. UC’s 2013 endowment of $1 Billion ranks 73rd in the United States among all colleges and universities, and 28th in the United States among public institutions.
The University of Cincinnati earned an A+ from Intead, an international student marketing company that conducted a “secret shopper” test, posing as an international student seeking information to begin fall 2014studies. In this responsiveness test, which included universities from the United States, Canada and Australia, UC was rated No. 1 for its impressive response.
In the International Student Barometer survey of 193 universities, UC ranked eighth in the world. The survey asks student opinion about their experiences in categories ranging from student learning to student life and social activities; support services (career advising, counseling, IT support); and experience on arrival (orientation services, registration).
The University of Cincinnati leads the world in Cooperative Education, which for more than 100 years has provided students with the opportunity to alternate full-time terms of school and work to provide them with a solid base of experience and professional development. In recent years, UC launched the Academic Internship Program, which provides access to opportunities for part-time internships and the Center for Service Learning and Civic Engagement to supporting campus-community connections. Germany and Japan have been the traditional international co-op destinations since international co-op began as a formal offering in 1990, and those placements have held steady in recent years. However, recently, co-op placements in China have been increasing dramatically. China is now the second-largest international destination for UC co-op students. InFY13, UC began the Singapore Experience, allowing UC co-op and internship students to live and work in Singapore to gain experience in and exposure to Asia, home to 60 percent of the world’s population.
The University of Cincinnati traces its origins to 1819when, due to the tireless energy of Daniel Drake – physician, scholar, teacher, and lecturer – the State of Ohio chartered both the Cincinnati College and the Medical College of Ohio. These pioneer institutions endure today as UC’s colleges of law and medicine.
Despite ambitious beginnings, scarce funds and internal friction handicapped both institutions and they fell into inactivity. In 1835, the Cincinnati College was revived under President William Holmes McGuffey, author of the famous McGuffey Readers. Again, financial trouble and the effects of the Civil War prevented the institution from achieving success. Only the college’s Law School survived.
In 1858, a wealthy merchant and landowner named Charles McMicken bequeathed his estate to Cincinnati for the creation of a municipal university. This gift provided the foundation of the University of Cincinnati, chartered in 1870 by the Ohio General Assembly.
During the next century, a number of Cincinnati educational institutions were merged with the University of Cincinnati, including the colleges of medicine, law and pharmacy. Also merging were the esteemed College-Conservatory of Music, the Ohio Mechanics Institute, and the Cincinnati Observatory. Over the course of its first century, UC founded colleges of engineering, business, education, nursing, and art. The university has awarded graduate degrees since 1878.
By the mid 1960s, it was apparent that the resources of the City of Cincinnati could not be stretched to accommodate the rapidly growing student body and an aging physical plant. The citizens of Cincinnati voted overwhelmingly to convert their university to full state status, and UC was named Ohio's 12th state university on July 1, 1977.
The University of Cincinnati has established a continuing reputation for academic accomplishment and innovative ideas. Since its founding, UC has been the source of many contributions to society, including the oral polio vaccine, the first program of cooperative education, the first electronic organ, the first safe anti-knock gasoline, and the first antihistamine.
Among the historic faculty or alumni of the University of Cincinnati are found President and later Chief Justice William Howard Taft; Albert Sabin, developer of the oral polio vaccine; Nobel Peace Prize winner and U.S. Vice President Charles G. Dawes; Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist Walt Handelsman; Doris Twitchell Allen, founder of Children's International Summer Village; Astronaut Neil Armstrong; soprano Kathleen Battle; Cleveland Abbe, whose work at UC led to the National Weather Service; Eula Bingham, environmental scientist and head of OSHA; Marilyn Gaston, assistant surgeon general; Broadway producer Kevin McCollum (“Rent”), author Thomas Berger (Little Big Man, Neighbors); prima ballerina Suzanne Farrell; sports greats Sandy Koufax, Oscar Robertson, Jack Twyman and Tony Trabert; architect Michael Graves; artists Tom Wesselmann and Gilbert Young; and Tony Award winner Faith Prince.

History
UFRGS’s history started with the foundation of the School of Pharmacy and Chemistry, in 1895, and, soon after, the School of Engineering. That was also the start of higher education in the state of Rio Grande do Sul. Still in the 19th century, Porto Alegre’s Faculty of Medicine and Faculty of Law were founded, what, in 1900, marked the beginning of humanitarian courses in the state. But it was only on November 28th, 1934, that Universidade de Porto Alegre was created, initially merging the School of Engineering, with the Astronomy, Power Engineering, and Industrial Chemistry Institutes; the Faculty of Medicine, with the School of Dentistry and Pharmacy; the Faculty of Law, with its School of Commerce; the Faculty of Agronomy and Veterinary Medicine; the Faculty of Philosophy, Sciences, and Humanities; and by the Fine Arts Institute. The third great moment of transformation of this university took place in 1947, when it started to be designated Universidade do Rio Grande do Sul, or URGS, incorporating the Faculty of Law and the Faculty of Dentistry from Pelotas, and the Faculty of Pharmacy from Santa Maria. In December 1950, the University was federalized, being shifted to the Union’s administrative sphere. Since then, UFRGS – Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, started to stand out in the national scenery, as one of the largest budgets in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, and as number one in publications and number two in scientific production, among federal universities, taking into consideration the number of teachers.

Research Profile
The reputation of the University of Bonn for excellence in research is rooted in a long tradition. The University was founded in 1818 by Friedrich-Wilhelm III, the Prussian king whose name it bears. Imbued with the spirit of Wilhelm von Humboldt, the University quickly joined the circle of Germany’s most distinguished universities and became a major pole of attraction for leading scholars. The list of famous professors ranges from the astronomer Friedrich Wilhelm Argelander (1799-1875), through the chemist August Kekulé von Stradonitz (1829–1896) and political economist Josef Schumpeter (1883–1950) to the philologist Ernst Robert Curtius (1886–1956) and the theologists Karl Barth (1886–1968) and Joseph Ratzinger (born 1927), later to become Pope Benedict XVI.
Today, the University of Bonn is a modern research university with a strong international orientation and a clear research profile. The University has developed internationally renowned areas of excellence in the fields of mathematics, economics, physics/astronomy, chemistry, biosciences, pharmacology, genetic medicine, immunology, neurosciences and ethics.
Other disciplines, such as geosciences and law, are of outstanding importance within the German research scene.
In recent years, the University of Bonn has proven its research potential and its commitment to academic excellence in numerous ways. The University can boast of a long list of award-winning scientists and scholars, e.g., with more than a dozen Leibniz Prize winners. Indeed, in the last 25 years two professors have received the Nobel Prize: Wolfgang Paul (for Physics, 1989) and Reinhard Selten (for Economics, 1994).
Employing a range of funding instruments, the University makes every effort to further sharpen its profile and to offer its top-level researchers the best possible conditions in which to work. High-achieving research fields are granted special allocations for staffing, facilities and materials. The University rewards successful bids for third-party funding with its own allocations under a bonus system and supports the best initiatives for new collaborative projects with seed money awarded through an internal competition. In this way, successful researchers receive recognition and reinforcement for their efforts.
National and International Research Cooperation
As a research university, the University of Bonn builds alliances with strong partners at all levels. It has developed close relations with the major research institutions in the region such as the Forschungszentrum Jülich, the Deutsche Zentrum für Luft und Raumfahrt (DLR), the Center for Advanced Studies and Research (caesar), the newly founded German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) and the local institutes of the Fraunhofer Society and Max Planck Society.
Internationally, the University of Bonn has established a wide-ranging network of partners both at the institutional and interpersonal level: Active cooperation and exchange agreements with more than 300 institutions around the globe form a sound basis for the university’s international reputation. Academics from Bonn are working in more than 1,500 international research groups or projects with colleagues from around the globe. The University strongly supports further initiatives for collaboration with other universities and research institutions.
Similarly, the University hosts a constantly growing number of international researchers – a trend confirmed by Bonn’s leading position in the statistics on grants and fellowships awarded by organizations like the prestigious Alexander von Humboldt-Foundation.
Research-oriented teaching
With about 36,000 students Bonn ranks among the big German universities. Each year more than 3,000 students graduate from Bonn; and in addition around 700 doctorates are awarded. Bonn is a classic university with a full range of courses. It offers about 90 undergraduate programs ranging from A for Asian Studies to Z for Zoology, with many interdisciplinary and international course models.
In order to recruit excellent international PhD students for the University’s key research areas, the University of Bonn has established the Bonn International Graduate School (BIGS) system. These purely English-taught PhD-programs in fields such as mathematics, economics, physics/astronomy, pharmaceutical science and chemical biology have strongly contributed to Bonn’s character as a truly international research university.
Infrastructure
The University of Bonn and the City of Bonn are closely intertwined. The University owns or uses more than 350 buildings throughout the Bonn area. The most impressive building, located in the heart of the City, is undoubtedly the historic Main Building, which was originally the palatial residence of the prince elector and is now home to the Faculties of Philosophy and Theology as well as the University Administration. Together with the adjacent Hofgarten park, this architectural landmark is an important ingredient of the University’s unmistakable charm. Other important university sites include the nearby Juridicum (Faculty of Law and Economics) and the grand buildings in the Poppelsdorf district, housing Pre-clinical Medicine, Agriculture and Natural Sciences. The research institutes and teaching hospitals of the Medical School are located above the City in Bonn’s Venusberg district. Newly constructed or acquired buildings, such as the state-of-the-art Life and Medical Sciences (LIMES) building or the Hausdorff Centre for Mathematics, which is housed in a distinctive palace-like building from the early 20th century, reflect the University’s successful effort to develop an infrastructure corresponding to its research profile.",,,4945.0,50.733334,7.1,https://www.shanghairanking.cn/_uni/logo/68c81f6c8.png

MUSE MONTPELLIER UNIVERSITY OF EXCELLENCE
FEED : Promoting an innovative agriculture to contribute to food security and environmental quality
PROTECT : Fostering a transition towards a sustainable-management oriented and environmentally-friendly society
CARE : Improving human health in changing environments
The “Montpellier University of Excellence” project gathers the forces of 19 institutions towards a common ambition: create in Montpellier a thematic research-intensive university that will be internationally recognized for its impact in the fields of agriculture, environment and health. For all its consortium members, this university strives to act as the academic partner they can establish strong ties with, and on which they can fully rely.
Collective intelligence to address societal challenges
The vision of a Planet with seemingly unlimited resources is coming to an end, and the world needs to sustainably manage limited and finite natural resources. Continuing human population growth increases the need for goods and services, resulting in substantial alteration of most ecosystems on Earth and food safety difficulties for the most fragile populations. At the same time, populations face novel health problems that may be linked to environmental issues or lifestyles (infectious diseases, chronic pathologies). Resulting factors – such as biodiversity loss, climate change, disturbance of the water cycle, changes in land use (urbanization, deforestation, intensive farming), food and nutrition insecurity, increasing number of toxic agents – bring the world to face unprecedented challenges and rely on scientific research for providing sustainable solutions to a series of issues that include: emerging diseases in man, plants, and animals, human health alterations, increasing pressure on ecosystems and the environment, non-sustainable management of natural resources such as those derived from agriculture, forestry, fisheries and aquaculture systems, and more.
Three major societal challenges
With significant scientific concentration in the Montpellier area in the fields of Agriculture, Environment and Health, MUSE brings together a scientific, institutional and economic community to address three major intertwined challenges that are consistent with the U.N. 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement on climate change: Feed, Protect, Care.
Towards a thematic research-intensive university
To address these challenges, the University of Montpellier and its 18 partners seek to create a thematic research-intensive university that will be internationally recognized for its impact in the fields of agriculture, environment and health.

University of Salerno,Italy,Salerno,34826.0,unisa.it,765,"Via Giovanni Paolo II, 132 ",1968.0,"The University of Salerno is ideally linked to the oldest academic institution in the Old Continent: the Schola Medica Salernitana. Founded in the eighth century AD, the School reached its peak between the 10th and 13th century. In addition to medicine, its lectures included philosophy, theology and law. Closed by royal decree in 1811 under Joachim Murat’s Napoleonic government, the School earned Salerno the title of Hippocratica Civitas (City of Hippocrates) after the famous Greek physician and treatise writer. In 1944, by decree of king Victor Emmanuel III, the Istituto Universitario di Magistero “Giovanni Cuomo” was founded. This became state-owned in 1968, changing its name into Facoltà di Magistero dell’Università degli Studi di Salerno. Within a few years, the Faculty was joined by many others which contributed to the formation of a major university. The Faculty of Arts was established in 1969; then the Faculty of Economics (1970); the Faculty of Mathematical, Physical and Natural Sciences and the Faculty of Law (1972); the Full Degree in Engineering (1983); the Faculty of Pharmacy (1991); the Faculty of Political Science (1992); the Faculty of Foreign Languages and Literature (1996); finally, the Faculty of Medicine and Surgery (2006). As of 2013, in accordance with Law 240/2010, the faculties have been reorganized, the departments reconfigured and their respective functions redesigned. The University – which currently counts around 40,000 students – has a very large catchment area including, beside Campania, the Italian regions of Basilicata, Calabria and Apulia. Since 1987, the University has had its headquarters in the Irno Valley, a few kilometers from Salerno, at the junction of motorway intersections that make it central and easy to reach. Organized in the form of a campus (the Fisciano and Baronissi campuses), the University boasts modern facilities and efficient services for orientation, teaching, studying and leisure. It is a very large and still expanding complex, which covers an area of about one hundred thousand square meters.
Modern service centres – such as libraries, the International/Erasmus Office, the University Language Centre, the University Centre for Orientation and Mentoring, the Placement Office, the Spin-Off Incubator – represent vital and valuable support for training. Furthermore, the Campus offers many other services such as residence halls for students and teachers, sports facilities, an indoor swimming pool, a theatre, a lecture hall, a nursery, open-air museum of contemporary art, parking areas, green areas and a thematic arboretum, thus providing a student-friendly environment to facilitate the entire academic journey. Thus, from traditionally being a place for integration of learning, the University becomes a place for integration of projects, cultures and - above all – people, by constantly encouraging study, research and life experiences to enhance cultural and human growth.
The mission of the University of Salerno is to carry out research and educational programmes, developing links with the surrounding area while respecting the environment, with the aim of creating, enriching and, at the same time, offering a scientific, cultural heritage to students, enterprises, institutions and in general to the whole community. In keeping with this mission and core values, which are a constant reference point, the institutional goals are as follows: Research, Teaching and Education, Support for outstanding students and the diversely able, Development of the Campus as a community of individuals who share the same interests and values, Development of links with key players in the local area.",21027.0,13799.0,586.0,40.683334,14.783333,https://www.shanghairanking.cn/_uni/logo-jpg/fc4e3f80000.jpg
University College London,United Kingdom,London,34785.0,ucl.ac.uk,16,Gower Street,1826.0,"University College London (UCL) is one of the world's top universities. Based in the heart of London, it is a modern, outward-looking institution. At its establishment in 1826, UCL was radical and responsive to the needs of society, and this ethos – that excellence should go hand-in-hand with enriching society – continues today. UCL opened up university education in England to those who had been excluded from it. In 1878, it became the first university in England to admit women students on equal terms with men. Academic excellence and conducting research that addresses real-world problems inform our ethos to this day and our plans for the future.
UCL's excellence extends across all academic disciplines; from one of Europe's largest and most productive hubs for biomedical science interacting with several leading London hospitals, to world-renowned centres for architecture (UCL Bartlett) and fine art (UCL Slade School).
UCL is in practice a university in its own right, although constitutionally a college within the federal University of London. With an annual turnover exceeding £1 billion, it is financially and managerially independent of the University of London.
The UCL community
UCL's staff and former students have included 29 Nobel prizewinners. It is a truly international community: more than one-third of our student body – more than 35,000 strong – come from 150 countries and nearly one-third of staff are from outside the UK.
UCL offers postgraduate research opportunities in all of its subjects, and provides more than 200 undergraduate programmes and more than 400 taught postgraduate programmes. Approximately 54% of the student community is engaged in graduate studies, with about 29% of these graduate students pursuing research degrees.
Quality of UCL's teaching and learning
UCL has the best academic to student ratio in the UK (1:10), enabling small class sizes and outstanding individual support (Times 2013).
In the Research Excellence Framework 2014 (REF2014, published in December 2014) – a new system for assessing the quality of research in UK higher education institutions – UCL was rated the top university in the UK for ‘research power’ (the overall quality of its submission multiplied by the number of FTE researchers submitted). It was rated top not only in the overall results, but in each of the assessed components: publications and other research outputs; research environment; and research impact.
REF2014 confirmed UCL’s multidisciplinary research strength, with many leading performances across subject areas ranging from biomedicine, science and engineering and the built environment to laws, social sciences and arts and humanities.
Equality
UCL is proud of its longstanding commitment to equality and to providing a learning, working and social environment in which the rights and dignity of its diverse members are respected.
Location and working environment
Based in Bloomsbury, UCL is a welcoming, inclusive university situated at the heart of one of the world's greatest cities. UCL's central campus is spread across approximately three square kilometres of central London.

Educational programmes and services
Italian universities issue the following qualifications, in compliance with Ministerial Decree No. 270 of 22/10/2004:
Laurea (L), on completion of an initial three-year study programme (180 credits)
Laurea Magistrale (LM) on completion of a further two-year study programme (120 credits)
Laurea Magistrale a ciclo unico (LMc.u.) only in some Faculties, on completion of a five- or six-year study programme (300 or 360 credits)
Then, for those who have obtained a Laurea Magistrale (LM):
Diploma di Specializzazione (DS) – Specialisation diploma.
Dottorato di Ricerca (DR) - PhD
More over Italian universities offer Masters with one-year (1st level) or two-year (2ndlevel) study programmes (at least 60credits). These are orientated towards entry into the working world. In the University of Florence there are courses at all levels listed above.
Apart from the courses, the University also offers students important auxiliary activities, including sports, languages and computer studies, the university choir and orchestra, in-faculty cultural and educational initiatives funded by university grants, psychological support and the chance of paid part-time collaboration in various types of work.
Research and knowledge transfer
The University of Florence is one of the largest and most productive public research systems in Italy. This result is related to the number of permanent and temporary researchers working in a wide range of disciplines and scientific fields, and the numerous junior scientists in training. It is also due to intensive participation in research programmes of national and international importance, the significant scientific results achieved, and the flow of funds which support research and knowledge transfer. This combination of factors qualifies the Florentine institution as a modern research university, and accounts for its excellent ranking in national and international classifications.
The researchers from the various departments of the University of Florence have at their disposal several research structures comprising interdepartmental and inter-university centres, as well as some specialised research units and laboratories.
In recent years the University of Florence has increasingly consolidated its activities in the sphere of knowledge transfer: from the filing of patents to the setting-up of joint workshops with firms, through to participation in spin-off companies.
Libraries and Museum
There are approximately three-and-a-half million books and a large number of periodicals available in five libraries covering the main disciplinary areas, with around 60 annexed reading rooms. The university library system also offers online catalogues and many other resources in digital format (journals, articles, books). Students are offered courses for guidance in the use of the library and in bibliographical research, as well as rooms with computer work stations that are also open in the evening.
In collaboration with other universities, important projects are underway which will increase direct access to databases and full-text electronic periodicals from individual work stations.
The digital publishing service provided by Firenze University Press., F.U.P., can be considered a model University publishing house; it cooperates with professors and researchers to promote and increase the value of scientific and didactic production, thus offering electronic and paper publications scientifically guaranteed by the University itself.
The most important natural history museum in Italy belongs to the University of Florence. It is also one of the oldest and most renowned museums at an international level: the Museum of Natural History, founded in 1775 by the Grand Duke Peter Leopold. The Botanical Garden section of the Museum is however even older, dating back to 1545. Consisting of six sections scattered over the old centre of Florence, the Museum houses 8 million exhibits, some of outstanding scientific and naturalistic importance: sixteenth-century herbaria and precious eighteenth-century waxworks, fossil skeletons of elephants and collections of multicoloured butterflies, large tourmaline crystals and Aztec relics, impressive wooden sculptures and the largest inflorescence in the world. A wonderful combination of nature, history, science and art emerges from this context.",32011.0,10228.0,3815.0,43.766666,11.25,https://www.shanghairanking.cn/_uni/logo/ffc7827db.png

It is committed to teaching, research, public life, and health care and has focused heavily on ensuring students have support to complete their degrees in a timely manner and are well prepared for successful lives after graduation. In 2019, the university was selected as a new member of the Association of American Universities—an invitation-only, prestigious group of 65 leading research institutions marked by excellence in academic expertise and research impact, student success, and securing resources in support of core missions.
The University of Utah has the highest graduation rate, the lowest average debt at graduation, and the highest average salary for graduates of any public institution in the state—and well above the national median.
Over the past nine years, the U has increased its six-year graduation rate by 16%. To achieve this success, the U focused on improving the advisor-student ratio and increasing advising, increasing availability of critical courses and online offerings, and strategically using scholarships to help students avoid the need to work outside of school. A new income-share agreement launched in 2019 is an innovative way to help students complete their degrees faster. U administration also announced a new campus innovation challenge aimed at incubating ideas to accelerate baccalaureate degree completion.
Salt Lake is the University of Utah’s “college city,” pairing outdoor adventure—including world-class skiing and five national parks (plus low-cost campus equipment rentals and outings to help students explore)—with sophisticated urban offerings from Utah Jazz NBA games to Broadway shows.
However, students don’t have to leave campus to experience outstanding music, theater, and dance performances. Talented students and faculty create and perform hundreds of shows each year, and the student government has hosted concerts featuring such artists as B.o.B and Icona Pop. Recent speakers have included former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden and the creator of Humans of New York.
Salt Lake City is top in the nation for diversity of jobs, according to LinkUp, which means there is an abundance of companies providing internship and employment opportunities. And, when students land that job downtown, their transportation is covered. U students have access to public transportation to, from, and around campus and the Salt Lake Valley for no additional cost.
The U offers an affordable investment in a high-quality and high-value degree by having the lowest out-of-state cost of attendance in the Pac-12, along with the opportunity to meet requirements for in-state tuition after just one year.
As a leader in global research and innovation, the U provides students with exciting ways to discover and nurture their interests.

VU University Amsterdam was the first university in the Netherlands established by a private person, with no interference from the church or the state. This heritage is still very much part of who we are: VU stands for Vrije Universiteit, which translates literally as 'Free University.' This name expressly states our independence: we are free of the state, the church or any commercial interests.However, science and academic pursuit can never be free of values, and values are always based on some form of conviction or philosophy. VU University attaches great value to different convictions, distinguishing itself from other universities by its willingness to open them to discussion. Since its foundation in 1880, the university has sought to maintain a link between academic pursuit on the one hand and the Christian conviction on the other. In recent decades we have engaged in open dialogue with other faiths and ethical systems. VU University Amsterdam has a strong sense of social engagement. It is an academic community which attaches importance to openness and which maintains a strong international outlook. It is a university which pursues innovation and progress, and which is able to take full advantage of the diversity of disciplines, nationalities and convictions on its campus. Through its research, VU University wishes to make a significant contribution in solving the major societal issues of our age. Another, equally important, objective is to help young people develop to become astute academics who, based on a strong sense of social engagement, are able to fill important positions in the international and intercultural society of the future. Accordingly, the university places a strong emphasis on the broad academic education of its students, informed by its traditional core values. Education and research are directly interlinked. The university offers education in those areas in which it has a strong reputation for research and in which there is a high demand for qualified professionals.VU University has formulated three core values which have a direct relationship with the institution’s Christian ethos: •Responsible: working in the service of man and society.•Open: diversity as a source of inspiration and innovation.•Personally engaged: an academic community in which every member is fully acknowledged.The ‘Vision for VU 2025’ sets out the situation in which the university wishes to find itself in 2025. In 2025, VU University will be notable:•as a strong research university, performing leading international research which makes a real contribution towards solving major societal issues.•by means of an (inter)nationally competitive range of graduate research and academic programmes.•as a scientific and academic educational institute serving the greater Amsterdam region. VU University provides good and well organized education to those with academic pre-qualifications (the VWO school diploma), helping them develop into critical and socially engaged academics.•by virtue of its unique character. The three core values will inspire and inform all education and research, and will be reflected in the day-to-day interaction between staff and students.To enhance the visibility of the university for students, researchers, granting organizations, public and private sector partners and others, VU University is to structure its education and research within four key themes:1.Human Health and Life Sciences, 2.

BJTU grew out of the Beijing Railway Management Institute, China’s first higher educational institute which was committed to fostering railway management talents and initiated modern China’s education in railway management and telecommunication.
BJTU has achieved distinction in offering a range of academic programs thanks to its development in over one hundred years. The university has been closely connected with the nation’s railway industry since its establishment. The faculty and students of BJTU have made great contributions to the growth of China’s railways, having participated in almost all the major events in different stages of development of the industry, from the movements for protecting railway rights and saving the nation in the 1900s to the great endeavor of building railways after the founding of the People’s Republic of China, from the massive industrial development movement in China’s southwest interior in the 1960s to the six railway speed-raising campaigns in recent years, from the completion of the Qinghai-Tibet Railway and the application of heavy-haul trains on the Datong-Qinhuangdao Railway to the building of high-speed railways and modern urban rail transit systems throughout the country in contemporary times. While improving its unique strength in such disciplines as Traffic and Transportation, Communications and Information, Economics and Management as well as Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, BJTU has fostered a strong sense of collaboration and innovation to improve its quality of education. The university has become an important base to turn out talents, especially outstanding talents in information technology and urban rail transit, for the economic and social development of China. It has also remained an influential institution which can help to solve significant technological and policy-making problems encountered in the development of the country’s economy, society and modern transportation systems.
BJTU has witnessed great changes since its founding. What remains unchanged is its emphasis on the principle of learning for practical application, meticulous scholarship, pursuit of innovation and practical and realistic work style. Inspired by these traditions, BJTU has maintained high academic standards and has been devoted to producing talents who can have both a firm footing in the basics and a strong sense of how the knowledge can be applied in the real world. The 10th Beijing Jiaotong University Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) was successfully held in April, 2012. BJTU has become a university administered and supported jointly by the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Railways and the Beijing People’s Municipal government since April 26, 2012 when an agreement was signed among the three parties.

University of Tübingen,Germany,Tübingen,27901.0,uni-tuebingen.de,142,Geschwister-Scholl-Platz,1477.0,"The University of Tübingen was founded in 1477, making it one of Europe’s oldest universities. More than 500 years later, the University continues to make history in Medicine, the Sciences and Humanities, combining excellent teaching with cutting-edge research. Researchers in Tübingen are breaking new ground in many fields – neuroscience, plant molecular biology, pharmaceuticals, cell biochemistry, environmental geoscience, elementary particle physics, educational research, archaeology and linguistics, to name just a few. The University encourages interdisciplinary research to broaden academic and scientific horizons and to promote creativity.
The University of Tübingen is continually developing new fields of research that encompass both basic research and application-oriented approaches. The University also offers advice on patents and start-ups to graduates whose ideas have commercial potential.
Outstanding achievement in basic research, whether in individual projects of collaborative research schemes, is a distinguishing feature at Tübingen. This is true of the whole range of subjects, from the Social Sciences (including Political Science and Education) to Mathematics and the Cognitive Sciences (which combine cognitive processes at human and machine level, including psychology and information technology), as well as applied research which probes the interplay of materials and sensors with living systems. The latest rankings place Tübingen among the top universities in Germany and in Europe. In the Humanities and Natural Sciences in particular, it was rated in the top range by the Centre for Higher Education Development (CHE).
The broad range of externally funded projects also underscores the quality of Tübingen’s research work. One of the most important sources here is the German Research Foundation (DFG), which primarily fosters high-level basic research and outstanding young researchers. It does so by way of different programs (such as local and trans-regional Collaborative Research Centers, “Excellence Clusters”, Research Training Groups and sponsored research groups). Currently, nine Collaborative Research Centers are in place at the University of Tübingen, along with ten Research Training Groups, across many specialist areas. All of these research projects – some of them in cooperation with partner institutions in Germany or other countries - are aimed at boosting broad-based multidisciplinary research.
The University and its top research areas have attracted a number of non-University research institutions that have set up branches in Tübingen, e.g. Max-Planck-Institute and research centers of the Helmholtz-Association. The compactness of the town means distances within Tübingen are relatively short.
Teaching at the University reflects its strong research profile in the natural sciences and humanities. Over 280 courses are offered by its seven Faculties. Innovative new options are constantly being added, such as International Economics, Medical Technology, Geoecology, Bioinformatics and Media Informatics. Students can choose from several different target qualifications, including Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees, the German Staatsexamen or PhD programs.
Like research, teaching at Tübingen has become increasingly international. Agreements with foreign universities make it possible to acquire a dual degree in selected fields of study, for example, such as Economics and Business Administration, History, Physics, Mathematics and Literature, with students spending one or more semesters at foreign universities. International Master’s courses held in English are a further option. These are already well established in applied Environmental and Geosciences, Neurology and Behavioral Research, Computer Linguistics and International Economics and Finance. The University’s international outreach is also impressive: some 13 percent of the student population comes from outside Germany, and every year 800 students from Tübingen participate in exchange programs with foreign research institutions and universities.
Tradition and innovation complement each other at the University of Tübingen. The University's history began in the late fifteenth century, when Count Eberhard the Bearded of Württemberg was given permission from the Pope to establish a place of learning. In Tübingen’s historical center there is hardly a building or a square that is not linked to a renowned scholar. Hegel, Hölderlin and Schelling, Mörike, Uhland and Kepler are among Tübingen's notables.
Over the centuries, Tübingen’s scientific research has repeatedly earned it the esteem of the global academic community. As early as 1863, Germany’s first independent Faculty of Natural Sciences was established here. Its teaching staff included Felix Hoppe-Seyler (1825-1895), who gave the blood pigment hemoglobin its name and is considered the father of modern biochemistry. One of his pupils, Friedrich Miescher (1844-1895), isolated a substance that he called “nucleic acid” while working on white blood cells in his laboratory in Hohentübingen Castle. Based on its chemical composition, it was later renamed deoxyribonucleic acid – DNA – the bearer of hereditary information. It has, of course, since become the focus of intensive research in Tübingen and around the world.
Along with Biochemistry, Medicine is among Tübingen’s strengths. Earlier than at other universities, the study of Medicine in Tübingen was geared towards investigating diseases in patients, rather than being restricted to the acquisition of theoretical knowledge. For the first time, patients were able to benefit directly from new discoveries. Germany’s first university hospital, founded in Tübingen in 1805, was part of this new approach.
Tübingen today remains a place of research and teaching. In addition to the nearly 85,000 inhabitants, there are 27,000 German and international students. Some 400 professors and more than 4000 other academic staff teach at the University’s seven Faculties.",,,3906.0,48.533333,9.05,https://www.shanghairanking.cn/_uni/logo/ffb5a5c9e.png

University of the Witwatersrand,South Africa,Johannesburg,27586.0,wits.ac.za,325,"1 Jan Smuts Avenue, Braamfontein, Johannesburg",1896.0,"The University of the Witwatersrand is a research-intensive university located in the heart of Johannesburg; a dynamic, metropolitan, world-class African city. Its distinctive capabilities have contributed to the global research and development agenda through leading-edge scholarship and have produced global citizens who are passionate about intellectual and social engagement. Wits’ academic and research excellence has grown from strength to strength since this University acquired its full status as a university in 1922. We aim to build on this reputation aggressively by intensifying our efforts to create an environment conducive to elevating the standard and impact of research, quality of teaching and learning, and the rigour of intellectual and social engagement, to new heights. The University of the Witwatersrand is an urban university located in the heart of a populous, vibrant but also complex metropolitan city, an interconnected economic and physical space now officially known as the Gauteng City Region (GCR). Wits has a strong history of achievements that distinguish it in many ways from other universities in South Africa. These realities include the following: 1. Wits has a very high proportion of its enrolments in the Science, Engineering and Technology disciplines, including high levels of Masters and Doctoral students; 2. Wits’ strength in postgraduate education is reflected in the fact that one-third of our students study at this level. Importantly, a quarter of these are international students who have been attracted to postgraduate study at Wits; 3. The high quality of Wits graduates is reflected in the fact that 90% of graduates that the University produces get permanent employment within 12 months of graduation (excluding those opting to pursue further studies or not to seek employment); 4. Wits’ powerful research track record is reflected, in part, in the 23 fields of study where the University ranks favourably in the world. We have shown especially strong growth in both the engineering and social science fields, signalling the breadth and balance of our disciplinary excellence. Further, our publication record shows a very high level of international collaboration: a substantial percentage (44.8%) of all papers published by Wits academics in International Science Index (ISI) journals have at least one international co-author; 5. Wits’ professional disciplines remain leaders in the country, producing graduates who are in demand globally. Wits continues to offer high-quality education in these disciplines, which cut across all faculties, putting emphasis on engineering, health sciences, commerce, law and some areas in the social sciences and the humanities; 6. The strength of Wits in the science and engineering disciplines has, over the years, created a strong culture of innovation and the creation of support structures for the commercialisation of ideas and research results. This, together with the activities of the Learning Information and Knowledge (LINK) Centre on ICT policy, regulation and management, and the more recently established Centre for Entrepreneurship and the teaching and research programmes on Strategic Management of Innovation, both in the Wits Business School (WBS), have considerably elevated Wits’ standing as a university of relevance in the “knowledge economy”; 7. Rapid urbanisation and growth of the city and the city region of Gauteng have created a slew of unique opportunities of engagement in a variety of other fields that have been and are being pursued with vigour by our academics. Strong examples include the Gauteng City Region Observatory (GCRO) and the Johannesburg Centre for Software Engineering (JCSE). Strong research and policy advice is provided by (among many others) the Forced Migration Studies Programme, at the Centre for Urbanism and Built Environment Studies (CUBES), and the Sociology of Work Project (SWOP); 8. Wits’ long-acknowledged leading position in the health sciences is augmented by its strong foothold in a typical vulnerable rural setting at Agincourt in Mpumalanga, where ongoing research on the ‘quadruple burden of disease’, coupled with the availability of extensive longitudinal datasets, provides unique opportunities for cutting-edge research into comparative studies in urban and rural settings, particularly if seen in conjunction with the activities of the Perinatal HIV Research Unit at Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital, which is one of the largest AIDS research centres in Africa, the Birth to Twenty programme and the Heart of Soweto study; 9. Wits has a strong tradition of public intellectual debate. Through its Distinguished Scholars Programme, Wits continues to attract internationally renowned scientists and Nobel Laureates from around the world to participate in scholarly activities of the University; and 10. In the past five years Wits has repeatedly been ranked as one of the top 500 of approximately 20 000 universities in the world. This attests to Wits’ existing internal capacity and the reality of its ability to produce research with high international impact and to offer high-quality education.",23597.0,3989.0,2141.0,-26.205172,28.049814,https://www.shanghairanking.cn/_uni/logo-jpg/945a175ff00.jpg

The first president was Shidehara Tan Tairaka Hiroshi. In 1945, the Republic of China won the war of resistance against Japan, and Taiwan was handed over to the Nationalist government of China. On November 15 of that year, Taihoku Imperial University was formally transferred to Chinese administration and renamed as National Taiwan University, with Dr. Tsung-lo Lo appointed as the first President.
During the Japanese occupation, the University consisted of two academic divisions: the Literature and Politics division and the Science and Agriculture division, with about 60 students enrolled each semester. The Medical division was added in 1936, followed by the Engineering division in 1943. Additionally, the University included the affiliated Agriculture and Forestry division, the affiliated Medical special division, a Tropical Medicine research institute and a preparatory school. Also, in 1943 the Southern Humanities research institute and the Southern Resource research institute were added. At that time, each division operated according to the lecture system, with a full-time Professor in charge of a faculty of associate professors, lecturers, teaching assistants and staff. These divisions and institutes were financially independent and had their own libraries. By 1945, the university expanded to five divisions, including Literature and Politics, Science, Agriculture, Medicine and Engineering, with a total enrollment of 382 students.
After restructuring in accordance with the ROC academic system in 1945, academic departments were established and the former divisions were renamed Colleges. The Literature and Politics division was divided into the College of Liberal Arts and the College of Law. Additionally, colleges of Science, Medicine, Engineering and Agriculture were established. Initially, there were six colleges with 22 departments. In 1945, student enrollment was 585. In the following years, the departments and colleges expanded in faculty and hardware in step with growing budgets and rising social expectations. In 1960, the night school was initiated on a trial basis, and in 1967 a new night school was established. In 1987, the College of Management was established, followed by the College of Public Health in 1993 and the College of Electrical Engineering in 1997. The College of Electrical Engineering was later rechristened the College of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering; in 1999, the College of Law was renamed the College of Social Sciences, and the Night Division and the Center for Continuing Education were combined to form the School for Professional and Continuing Studies.

Bielefeld University,Germany,Bielefeld,25896.0,uni-bielefeld.de,671,Universitätsstrasse 25,1969.0,"Bielefeld University - Transcending Boundaries
Interdisciplinary - Communicative - Innovative - International
Bielefeld University was founded in 1969 with an explicit research assignment and a mission to provide high-quality research-oriented teaching. Today it encompasses 14 faculties covering a broad spectrum of disciplines in the humanities, natural sciences, social sciences, and technology. With about 25,000 students in 118 degree courses and about 3,200 staff members (including 279 professors and lecturers as well as 1,800 academic staff) it is one of Germany's medium-sized universities.
Since its foundation, Bielefeld University has developed guided by the principle of interdisciplinarity. Behind this lies the conviction that complex problems can no longer be adequatety addressed with disciplinary approaches alone. In this case, interdisciplinarity stands for a spectrum of multiple perspective approaches of varying kinds and intensity. This perspective penetrates every aspect of the university’s identity. Even the University building itself stands as an architectural statement of interdisciplinarity. It brings together nearly all the facilities under one roof, which is unique in Germany. Its striking architectural structure draws people together from the most varied of areas over short distances.
At Bielefeld University, a culture of communication has developed between teaching staff and students, between scientists, university management and administrative staff, whose openness towards new and unconventional ideas is characteristic. This culture formed the basis of important forward-thinking decisions and has significantly contributed to the successes of the University. An example of this is the establishment of the Faculty of Technology (1990), as well as the Faculty of Health Sciences, which is itself singular in Germany. Both these faculties are evidence of the University’s institutional ability to innovate as the scope and demands of interdisciplinary evolves.
Springing from the Bielefeld principle of ‘Transcending Boundaries’, its research profile is interdisciplinary at its core, involving various faculties and central academic institutes – resulting in cutting-edge research carried out at the highest international level.The research profile of Bielefeld University is oriented to big issues relevant to science and society, primarily at the productive interfaces between disciplines.The support of researchers is paramount - exemplified by the world-renowned Centre for Interdisciplinary Research, which is one of the number of ways the university fosters academic talent - along with excellent infrastructure and a range of research and career development services.The University also distinguishes itself in its teaching through its specific profile that is based on dense networks across disciplines. According to the most relevant rankings and assessments, Bielefeld University Library is one of the best and most service-oriented university libraries in Germany.
In addition to interdisciplinarity, innovation and an overall commitment to excellence, diversity also plays a major role for the University, which is committed to inclusion, equality and opportunity for all with regard to gender, race, culture, sexuality, and/or disability. This is also evident in the central commitment to internationalization both to broaden the perspectives of all members of the student body and staff, both national and international, but also to create an environment where students and researchers from other countries, cultures and traditions feel comfortable and safe away from home. This is a commitment that is extended to its services for international students, researchers and employees at a multitude of levels with the goal to help create a home away from home, thus providing the proper context and environment where learning, study and research can be most productive for everyone.",14584.0,11312.0,1805.0,52.033333,8.533333,https://www.shanghairanking.cn/_uni/logo/f6151fa61.png

Washington State University,United States,Washington,24884.0,wsu.edu,382,PO Box 641227,1890.0,"At Washington State University, you’ll discover a close-knit community of scholars driven by a common passion: making the world a better place. That commitment—passed along from one generation of Cougar alumni to the next—reflects a deeply held university belief that an informed intellect, combined with a confident, can-do spirit, can improve the quality of life for others while also yielding personal success and fulfillment.
You’ll see that principle in action on a daily basis at WSU. Each year, thousands of students share their time and talents to benefit the community through civic engagement. It permeates our teaching and research, which is focused on big ideas for solving problems in areas like health, food, sustainability, and leadership. And it’s reflected throughout our diverse campus community, which nurtures and challenges our members to invest their talents and interests in a variety of academic and social activities.
Here, hands-on learning is a given. Students work side-by-side with professors whose scholarship and research is discussed globally. Many undergraduates enter national competitions in areas as varied as robotics, interior design, and business. Others present papers at conferences and publish their findings in scholarly journals.
We also strive to deepen our students’ understanding of and connectedness to the global community. Students can choose from more than 500 study abroad programs. Over 1,200 students from all corners of the globe enroll at the main WSU campus in Pullman, adding a rich layer of cultural diversity. The Honors College curriculum immerses students in the study of international issues.
An institutional commitment to enroll a more ethnically diverse student body continues to deliver dividends. 34 percent of the student body is comprised of minority students—the highest percentage in WSU history—and the number is expected to grow in future years.
The University is also dedicated to sustainability—an effort that has included everything from the launch of a bike-sharing program and recycling activities, to constructing new buildings to meet green building standards. In addition, hundreds of high school students from the region participate in WSU’s annual Imagine Tomorrow competition, which challenges them to develop creative solutions for society’s energy challenges.
Undergraduate students can choose from 200-plus fields of study, and many academic programs rank among the nation’s best. Among them: the Edward R. Murrow College of Communication, where students gain practical experience at student-run television and radio stations, and the College of Pharmacy, whose students are consistent award winners in the American Pharmacists Association competitions for business plans, patient outreach activities, and patient counseling skills, as well as volunteer service in pharmacy.
Graduate students from around the world enroll in WSU's nearly 150 master's, doctoral, and professional degree programs such as medicine, molecular biosciences, physics, zoology, veterinary medicine, and the plant sciences. In 2015, the university established the Elson S. Floyd College of Medicine, which prepares physicians to serve Washington communities where they are needed most.
An award-winning Student Recreation Center featuring cardio and weight equipment, courts for basketball, volleyball, and badminton, and a swimming pool and spa inspire students to maintain their physical and mental health. A revitalized student union building, a classroom building featuring the latest teaching technology, and a major expansion of the Pac-12 Cougars’ football stadium are recent examples of WSU’s commitment to providing amenities that directly benefit students.
The location of WSU’s flagship campus in Pullman, a small town in southeastern Washington, creates the quintessential college town environment—meaning that Cougar spirit permeates life on and off-campus for the over 17,000 students enrolled here. The University also has thriving regional campuses in Everett, Spokane, the Tri-Cities, and Vancouver, as well as a Global Campus offering online degrees to students worldwide.
The University works to improve the quality of life for all Washington citizens through its agricultural research and extension facilities statewide.

University of Salamanca,Spain,Salamanca,24761.0,usal.es,655,Patio Escuelas Menores 1,1218.0,"The University of Salamanca was founded in 1218. It is the oldest founded university in Spain and the fourth oldest European university, besides being considered the alma mater of Latin American universities, for their intense relationship at the beginning of higher education in Latin America. The University of Salamanca is of medium size made up of 9 teaching and administrative campuses offering 80 official degrees, and 27 double degrees in all branches of knowledge. It has around 22,000 registered undergraduate students. If we add to this figure the number of registered students in the 78 University Masters, 41 doctorate programmes and other studies, the figure is about 30,000 students. The University of Salamanca has always prided itself on its ability to attract students from outside of ""its natural market"". It is the second university in the country to attract a higher number of students from outside its region. This characteristic of the university has become more pronounced in recent years. Also worth noting is our capacity to attract foreign students from Europe and from the rest of the world. These figures are also rising steadily in our doctorate programmes where 15% of students are of European origin and 36% from the rest of the world, especially from Latin America. The University of Salamanca is the European university with the ninth largest number of incoming Erasmus students and ranks number five among Spanish Universities. However if we consider the importance of Erasmus students in relation to the size of our university, they represent 4.75% of the total number of students, this is in fact, the highest percentage among medium to large public universities. Each year, the University receives more than 10,000 foreign students, including those who come to learn Spanish, Erasmus students, and Graduate and Postgraduate students with a non-Spanish mother tongue, what makes the city internationally renowned for its university atmosphere. The academic institution main research fields of knowledge are Biosciences and Spanish courses for non-native speakers. There are also other significant fields such as Art and Humanities, ICT, Mathematics, Physics, Geology, Law, Economy, Education or Psychology. The University of Salamanca has institutes and research groups in the field of the Biosciences that are European and global references in their area: The Institute for Cell and Molecular Biology of Cancer – Centre for Cancer Research (IBMCC-CIC) (www.cicancer.org) is particularly important owing to the leading international role of some of its teams and the acknowledgement it has received from other professionals, with several prestigious national and international awards. The Institute of Functional and Genomic Biology (IBFG) CSIC-University of Salamanca (www.imb.usal.es) has gained international recognition in the field of mycology. The Institute of Neurosciences of Castile and Leon – INCYL (www.incyl.usal.es) carries out important activities in national and international projects in the field of basic and applied neurosciences. The DNA Bank participates in the Human Genome Project, and is a worldwide recognized technological platform created to support biomedical research. In the area of agro-biotechnology, the Spanish-Portuguese Centre for Agricultural Research – CIALE (www.ciale.es) is carrying out research in agro-biotechnology, biodiversity, genetic improvement, plant production, plant health, etc. The Centre for Ultra-fast Ultra-intense Pulsed Lasers – CLPU (www.clpu.es) is a singular scientific infrastructure created as a consortium between the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitivity, the Regional Government of Castile and Leon and the University. One of the main assets of the University is the pursuit of excellence in the field of Spanish Language. In order to achieve this goal, the University builds on the collaboration of the most prestigious national and international teams and productions. There are many data that attest to this: It has more than 600 researchers in Spanish Language. The teaching of Spanish as a Foreign Language at the University of Salamanca began in 1929 and the Department of Spanish Language wrote the first communicative teaching manuals of the Spanish Language. Another force that drives the University is related to the assessment and certification of the Spanish Language. In this field, the University of Salamanca has researchers and teams of experts in the calibration and preparation of tests, the training of testers, and a team of more than 120 test markers, as well as technical staff and all the computer programmes and equipment required. In 1990, the University of Salamanca and the Spanish Ministry of Education signed a Cooperation Agreement that gave birth to the DELE certificates (Diploma of Spanish as a Foreign Language), official Spanish language exams. The “Instituto Cervantes” joined us in this task in 1992, after the establishment of agreements with the other two institutions. In 1990, the University of Salamanca and the University of Cambridge founded the Association of Language Testers in Europe (ALTE), a reference agency in Europe for the research, development and practice of examinations and tests in European languages. This association is currently made up of 31 members, representing 26 European languages. Since February 2008, the University of Salamanca has been part of the consortium controlling the project of indicators of Language Competences in the European Union (SURVEYLANG), together with the University of Cambridge, the Goethe-Institut, the Instituto Cervantes, CITO, the Alliance Française, the Università per Stranieri di Perugia and the Gallup Institute. The University of Salamanca is a member of the EPSO project (European Personnel Selection Office), which develops tests in 24 languages for the selection of translators for the European Union. The University of Salamanca together with the ""Instituto Cervantes"", the National Autonomous University of Mexico, and the University of Buenos Aires, has developed the first digital certificate of Spanish Language (SIELE) in the world. All these initiatives underscore the leading position of the University of Salamanca in the certification and assessment of the Spanish Language, together with its prospect of becoming a Campus of International Excellence.

UP is located in several cities: Poitiers (3 geographical campuses), Niort, Angoulême but also in Châtellerault, Segonzac and Royan. It is the only university of the French northern “Nouvelle-Aquitaine” region, whose population is about 1.8 million inhabitants (former “Poitou-Charentes” region), with an economy mainly based on small and medium-size businesses.
UP is composed of 14 colleges including 6 institutes and 1 engineering school. UP hosts 34 Research Units, including 3 jointly operated with Inserm and 12 with CNRS*. In 2019, UP started to evolve its internal structure into research thematic institutes in order to reinforce the legibility of its actions in research and education, and to go beyond its college organization. Each of these institutes is a multidisciplinary group gathering trainings, research laboratories and partners around a specific scientific or thematic field.
The values of the University of Poitiers. The UP is committed to the University in the City concept, as a humanistic, citizen-centered, and sustainable model. This model contributes to identifying universities as central actors of the Knowledge Square (education, research, innovation, service to society). This model establishes sustainability and quality as basic requirements for a responsible university. The “City” refers to a universal entity playing a shaping role within its environment and at all levels (municipality, large urban area, regional, national, and European territories). The model reasserts the idea that universities play a central role in the development of cities and those cities represent a fundamental framework and are a catalyst for universities’ development. Cities and universities have a common and vital interest in the development of education and knowledge.
Since 2020, UP is coordinating the EC2U Alliance (European Campus of City-Universities). The EC2U Alliance indeed promotes an unprecedented challenge-based global initiative that leans on the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Among the 17 UNSDGs, the EC2U universities have identified and selected 3 of them that will be guiding the Alliance’s activities during the first phase of its development (2020-2023): good health and well-being, quality education, sustainable cities and communities.

Comenius University Bratislava is a modern European university. It offers a wide selection of study programmes (more than 740) at the levels of Bachelor, Master, Doctor and PhD across its thirteen faculties. Several of these study programmes are unique in Slovakia. Students can choose from a wide variety of areas of human knowledge to study; from medicine to humanities and social sciences, to natural sciences, mathematics, theology, and much more.
Comenius University is also a research institution that runs hundreds of local and international research projects. Consequently, many of its students do research as part of their studies and can also participate in projects, grants, and internships. Year after year, Comenius University leads other Slovak universities in both the number of students studying abroad, and international students studying in Slovakia.
EDUCATION
Comenius University Bratislava is the oldest and largest university in Slovakia. Its mission is to enhance the scientific and cultural prospects of the society and its economic prosperity. In the previous academic year, the university’s thirteen faculties provided tuition to over 22 000 students at all study levels. More than a third of all international students in Slovakia study at Comenius University. The majority of international students study at the Faculties of Medicine in Bratislava and in Martin, and at the Faculty of Management. Young researchers - PhD students - represent a significant scientific potential. Most of PhD students in Slovakia (over one third) study at Comenius University.
SCIENCE AND RESEARCH
Comenius University is one of Slovakia’s most prominent research institutions in terms of the number of researchers, the ability to obtain research grants, and the results achieved. An independent assessment of the quality of its scientific output confirms the leading position of Comenius University Bratislava in Slovak science. Comenius University researchers generated up to one quarter of all world-class research in Slovakia. The Ministry of Education, Research, Development and Youth of the Slovak Republic regularly evaluates research, development, artistic and other creative activities (VER - Verification of Excellence in Research). The results of this assessment may have an impact on the financing of public universities from 2024.
The important thing for students to know is that the research teams working at Comenius University, who are excellent in an international context, also teach here. The creative activity of young researchers, teachers, and internal PhD candidates under 30 is also supported through Comenius University’s own grant scheme, CU Grants. Comenius University has other scientific establishments which help generate top quality research and provide a connection to practical applications, such as the Science Park, BioMed in Martin and the Centre for Nuclear and Accelerator Technologies (CENTA).
INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS
Comenius University maintains both bilateral and multilateral international contacts. The contacts lead to student and teacher exchanges, supported mainly through the Erasmus+ programme. Comenius University cooperates with eight universities in the nine-strong ENLIGHT alliance, which was expanded in December to include a tenth university - the Swiss University of Bern.
INFRASTRUCTURE
Comenius University is intimately linked to the city of Bratislava. It is the soul and lungs of the city. Parts and facilities of the university can be found in all corners of the city. Comenius University does not only consist of its faculties; it also has hospitals, pharmacies, the Botanical Garden, a garden of medicinal plants, a herbarium, dozens of dormitory buildings, libraries, the Comenius University Press and the Comenius University Archive. Although Comenius University is not a campus-type university, this has its advantages. When you are getting to know the individual parts of the university, you will travel around the whole city and get to explore it as well. One of the faculties – the Jessenius Faculty of Medicine – is in Martin. Several more university facilities are in other cities of Slovakia.
FUTURE DIRECTION
In its hundred years of existence, Comenius University has established itself as the most prominent and largest university in Slovakia. It entered its second century with a clear goal – to maintain its good reputation, to continue enhancing its prestige in Europe and worldwide, and to continue improving the quality of education and research activities. The strategy of development of Comenius University reflects the changes happening to universities and societies in Slovakia and worldwide. The goal is to reinforce its position of the most important university and centre of science in Slovakia, and to become a sought-after partner for education and research internationally.

University of Oviedo,Spain,Oviedo,20900.0,uniovi.es,727,Calle San Francisco nº 3,1608.0,"A University on its way towards excellence
The University of Oviedo was founded in 1608 by Archbishop Fernando de Valdés Salas. Throughout its 400 years of history, the academic institution has been constantly growing and cementing its roots in the region.Since its foundation, the Historic Building (located in the city centre, where Arts, Law, and Theology were taught) hosts a historic and cultural legacy that has its turning point towards the end of the 19th century.At that time, the Group of Oviedo creates the Extensión Universitaria (University Extension), which would have a remarkable impact on the first decades of the 20th century.
The ‘OctoberRevolution’ in 1934 set a turning point in the history of the University, as the bibliography, many archives, and works of art were destroyed. After this event, a difficult period was started in order to recover more than 300 years of history. These efforts did not conclude until the 1940s.
Clearly, the 20th century is a foothold for the University and its integration in the regional territory. The academic needs run in parallel to the growth of the teaching institution: the University is provided with new buildings in Oviedo and also in other Asturian locations(Gijón and Mieres).
In the second half of the last century the university keeps growing on the basis of the increase in the number of students. The degrees offered in Oviedo are taught in several campuses scattered in the city, whereas in Gijón and Mieres the new campuses have been specialized by offering courses on particular fields.
In November 2009, the University of Oviedo was awarded with the Campus of International Excellence, a public call promoted by the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Science and Innovation in the framework of the Strategy 2015. This initiative was intended to improve the teaching and research quality of Spanish universities in order to place them in the best international rankings.
The University of Oviedo was awarded with the Campus of International Excellence with its project Ad Futurum. From the 17thto the 21stcentury: Looking Back,Looking Ahead. This proposal has been supported by the whole Asturian society, with more than 200 companies and institutions integrated in the project. The keystones of Ad Futurum are internationalization, talent acquisition, improving quality in teaching and research, promoting entrepreneurship, optimizing knowledge transfer and developing sustainable campuses that are environmentally-friendly and integrated in the territory. These objectives are intended to promote and stimulate the business sector in the region.
The University of Oviedo has adapted all its programmes to the European Higher Education Area (EHEA). In addition, it has started an organization process of its centres in order to group related degrees and promote a more efficient management. As long as internationalization is concerned, the academic institution has signed more than 30 agreements with foreign universities in the last year and it has opened new collaboration channels in the fields of teaching and research. To foster the international dimension of the institution and attract international students and lecturers,the University is aimed at promoting bilingualism in degrees and graduatecourses.
Our main goal is that the University of Oviedo improves its position in the international rankings, becoming an attractive institution for international students and lecturers at the same time it contributes to generate wealth by means of a more effective and optimized cooperation with the business sector.",17533.0,3367.0,590.0,43.363224,-5.853128,https://www.shanghairanking.cn/_uni/logo/0468e16fc.png

Here are a few research highlights:
- For 60 years, Southampton researchers have been at the forefront of the global revolution in digital communications. The University is the birthplace of the optical amplifier technology that led to the development of the Internet and created a global telecommunications network.
- Our staff and students have worked to support over 1,000 elite athletes as part of their preparation for the Beijing, Vancouver and the London 2012 games. Their engineering excellence has contributed to sports that won 50 per cent of Team GB's medals at the London 2012 Olympics, and is now supporting athletes for Rio 2016.
- Our researchers have created technology to store the history of the human race in a simple piece of glass for billions of years. Using optical discs made of nanostructured glass, they have already saved copies of important documents, such as the King James Bible, the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Magna Carta in the format. A standard-sized disc can store around 360 terabytes of data, with an estimated lifespan of up to 13.8 billion years and withstand temperatures of 1,000°C.
- Our engineers designed and flew the world’s first ‘printed’ aircraft, which could revolutionise the economics of aircraft design.
- Our researchers have discovered communities of species previously unknown to science on the seafloor near Antarctica, clustered in the hot, dark environment surrounding hydrothermal vents. Other deep-sea expeditions revealed details of the world's most extreme deep-sea volcanic vents, five kilometres down in a rift in the Caribbean seafloor
- Southampton is a world leader in biometrics and is at the forefront of research into gait biometrics that identifies and recognises people by the way they walk. The science has the potential to revolutionise the methods used by security agencies to identify criminals, it has improved national security and has been used in covert surveillance to identify terrorists in ports and airports.
- Our research into the natural antimicrobial properties of copper is helping to tackle one of today’s most formidable healthcare challenges – hospital superbugs such as MRSA and norovirus. Southampton research has shown that copper completely destroys the bacteria’s DNA in minutes.
- Our researchers are at the forefront of improving our understanding of musculoskeletal and metabolic conditions throughout people’s lives, and through that understanding to develop preventive strategies.
- The University leads the UK in cancer immunology research. Our exciting discoveries are moving out of the laboratory into clinical trials, where they are already making a world of difference to people with cancer. We are currently fundraising £25m to build a new Centre for Cancer Immunology, due to open in 2017. Through connecting world-leading scientists with cutting-edge facilities, the Centre aims to accelerate research progress and save more lives from cancer.

The principal campuses (Central, Anchieta, Guajara and Ofra) of this learning institution are located in the city of La Laguna, which was declared World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1999, although it also has other centres scattered throughout Santa Cruz de Tenerife. As of academic year 2009/ 2010, the university has 25,103 students, 1,764 professors and 843 administrative and services employees, and offers 41 bachelor degrees and 30 postgraduate degrees regarding all knowledge areas. Its history expands through more than 200 years. First known as “Universidad de San Fernando” (University of St. Ferdinand), a Royal Decree from king Carlos IV ordered on March 11, 1792 the creation of the first literary university in the Canary Islands in La Laguna, which was then the capital of Tenerife. However, the unstable political landscape after 1793 made it impossible to follow through with the decree. The situation was solved after the restoration of Bourbon Dynasty, with another decree from king Fernando VII in 1816, in which it was finally established the creation of a university in the city of San Cristóbal de La Laguna named. It opened its doors on January 12, 1817, but the numerous shortcomings of the university, especially the lack of resources and the unstable teaching staff, led to a succession of orders to close and re-open the institution until it was definitively abolished in 1845 by a Royal Order that reduced the number of universities in Spain to ten and ordained the creation of the Canaries Institute in La Laguna. During a visit of Alfonso XIII to the institute in 1906, its director, Adolfo Cabrera Pinto, asked the King to re-establish the university. His petition was rewarded in 1913 by a decree that opened the first academic year of the Faculty of Philosophy and Letters and Law preparation, and the history of the University of La Laguna as we know it finally started. During the 20th century, the institution increased in studies, facilities and number of students, teachers and researchers. Two hundred years after it was founded, it continues to be a point of reference in the Canarian community and also reaches out to the world across the Atlantic. In 2010 it joined forces with the other higher learning institution from Canary Islands (the Universitiy of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria) to develop the project ""Campus Atlántico Tricontinental"" (Tri-continental Atlantic Campus), which has gained a quality mention from the Spanish Ministry of Education. This initiative aims to increase the international influence of Canary Island’s universities in South America, North Africa and Europe, especially in research areas such astrophysics, alternative energies and sea studies.",17579.0,2563.0,939.0,,,https://www.shanghairanking.cn/_uni/logo/403bc1694.png

Teachers from other academic institutions in Israel provided higher education in Beer-Sheva. Continuous efforts to convince the government to establish a full-fledged university in the Negev, in southern Israel, were fruitful, and on November, 9, 1969, Yigal Alon, the Minister of Education and acting Prime Minister, announced that the Government had decided to build and support the “University of the Negev.” In November 1970, the first meeting of the Board of Governors took place, and the “Institute for Higher Education in the Negev” became the “University of the Negev.”
The University was formally accredited by the Council for Higher Education (CHE) in 1973 and after the death of David Ben-Gurion, Israel’s first and legendary prime minister, it was officially named “Ben-Gurion University of the Negev.”
The University started to take shape on the Beit HIAS (a former hostel) campus in Beer-Sheva during the early 1970s. It gradually came to include faculties of Natural Sciences, Engineering Sciences, Humanities and Social Sciences, Health Sciences, a Medical School, Institutes for Applied Research, an Institute for Desert Research, and the Ben-Gurion of the Negev Heritage Institute.
During the second half of the 1970s, the CHE authorized the University to grant Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) and Medical Doctor (MD) degrees. The Leon and
Matilda Recanati School of Community Health Professions was also founded during this period.
During the 1980s, growth continued, new departments and study programs were opened, and the number of applications increased. In the early 1990s, academic cooperation agreements with many institutions throughout the world were signed, students from abroad were admitted to the University, and the number of students surpassed 10,000.
The past ten years have been marked by a rapid increase in the number of students, from about 11,000 in 1995/6 to over 19,500 by 2011/2012. The Kreitman School of Advanced Graduate Studies, which administers all PhD studies, was established in 1997, and generous fellowships began to be offered to outstanding PhD candidates and post-doctoral fellows. During that period, new departments and study programs were added, among them the School of Management (which has recently become The Guilford Glazer Faculty of Business and Management), the Department of Middle East Studies, and the Department of Politics and Government.
The University has five campuses: (a) three in Beer-Sheva: the Marcus Family Campus (the main campus), the David Tuviyahu Campus (formerly Beit HIAS) and the David Bergmann Campus, (b) one in Sede Boqer (south of Beer-Sheva), which includes: the Jacob Blaustein Institutes for Desert Research, the Albert Katz International School for Desert Research, and the Ben-Gurion of the Negev Research Institute for the Study of Israel and Zionism, and (c) the University’s newest campus in Eilat, established in 2003.

Baylor University,United States,Waco,19984.0,baylor.edu,544,"Mark and Paula Hurd Welcome Center, 905 S. University Parks Dr., Waco, TX 76706, USA",1845.0,"The mission of Baylor University is to educate men and women for worldwide leadership and service by integrating academic excellence and Christian commitment within a caring community.
Chartered in 1845 by the Republic of Texas and affiliated with the Baptist General Convention of Texas, Baylor is both the state's oldest institution of higher learning and the world's largest Baptist university. Established to be a servant of the church and of society, Baylor seeks to fulfill its calling through excellence in teaching and research, in scholarship and publication, and in service to the community, both local and global. The vision of its founders and the ongoing commitment of generations of students and scholars are reflected in the motto inscribed on the Baylor seal: Pro Ecclesia, Pro Texana — For Church, For Texas.
Pro Ecclesia. Baylor is founded on the belief that God's nature is made known through both revealed and discovered truth. Thus, the University derives its understanding of God, humanity and nature from many sources: the person and work of Jesus Christ, the biblical record, and Christian history and tradition, as well as scholarly and artistic endeavors. In its service to the Church, Baylor's pursuit of knowledge is strengthened by the conviction that truth has its ultimate source in God and by a Baptist heritage that champions religious liberty and freedom of conscience. Without imposing religious conformity, Baylor expects the members of its community to support its mission. Affirming the value of intellectually informed faith and religiously informed education, the University seeks to provide an environment that fosters spiritual maturity, strength of character and moral virtue.
Pro Texana. Integral to its commitment to God and to the church is Baylor's commitment to society. Whereas that society in the mid 1800s was limited to Texas, today Baylor's sphere of influence is indeed the world. The University remains dedicated to the traditional responsibilities of higher education — dissemination of knowledge, transmission of culture, search for new knowledge, and application of knowledge — while recognizing the global proportions these responsibilities have assumed. Moreover, within the context of an ethnically and culturally diverse community, Baylor strives to develop responsible citizens, educated leaders, dedicated scholars and skilled professionals who are sensitive to the needs of a pluralistic society. To those ends, Baylor provides expanded opportunities for civic education and for church and community service at home and abroad.
Pro Ecclesia, Pro Texana. Baylor University is committed to excellence at the undergraduate, graduate and professional levels. Within the undergraduate programs, the University seeks to familiarize students with the principal bodies of knowledge, cultural viewpoints, belief systems and aesthetic perspectives that affect the world in which they live. Within the graduate and the professional programs, the University provides advanced educational opportunities to develop ethical and capable scholars and practitioners who contribute to their academic disciplines, professional fields and society. Baylor encourages all of its students to cultivate their capacity to think critically, to assess information from a Christian perspective, to arrive at informed and reasoned conclusions, and to become lifelong learners. Beyond the intellectual life, the University pursues the social, physical, ethical and spiritual development of each student.
Aware of its responsibility as the largest Baptist educational institution in the world and as a member of the international community of higher learning, Baylor promotes exemplary teaching, encourages innovative and original research, and supports professional excellence in various specialized disciplines. Advancing the frontiers of knowledge while cultivating a Christian world-view, Baylor holds fast to its original commitment — to build a university that is Pro Ecclesia, Pro Texana.",15083.0,4901.0,907.0,31.549168,-97.146385,https://www.shanghairanking.cn/_uni/logo/231bcc96b.png

James Cook University,Australia,Townsville,19902.0,jcu.edu.au,444,1 James Cook Drive,1961.0,"Current Circumstances
James Cook University was established to conduct teaching and research on areas of importance to North Queensland and the tropics world-wide. Our focus is on producing graduates who have the expertise and intellectual curiosity to make a difference in their profession and their communities and conducting the research needed to meet the challenges facing the tropical world. We are also committed to producing the professional workforce for under-served communities and providing access and opportunity to those who may not have previously been able to access higher education. Started in 1960 in Townsville as a University College of The University of Queensland and established as a university in 1970, James Cook University has since expanded into a multi-campus institution with the largest campuses located in Townsville and Cairns. Our footprint now extends beyond northern Queensland to include our Singapore Campus which combines research and teaching and demonstrates our commitment to the Asian region and internationalisation, particularly in the tropics. JCU also has a presence in Brisbane by means of a campus operated by Russo Higher Education. At JCU staff and students benefit from our tropical location to conduct at or above world standard research in the following areas: environmental science and management; fisheries sciences; geochemistry, geology, evolutionary biology, plant biology, zoology; tourism; inorganic chemistry, oceanography; physical geography and environmental geoscience; biochemistry and cell biology; genetics; materials engineering; immunology; neurosciences; nursing; specialist studies in education; anthropology; human geography; linguistics; and historical studies. The University is rated in the top 4% of universities in the world in the Academic Ranking of World Universities (Also known as the Shanghai Jiao Tong World Rankings), an achievement equaled/surpassed by only two other Queensland Universities. We recognise that the University is judged not only on its quality but equally on its relevance and impact beyond academia. Accordingly we commit ourselves to research of excellence and high impact, particularly on issues of critical importance to the world’s tropics. We recognise our obligation to engage with industry and government, commercialise our research findings and achieve critical mass through productive research partnerships with other research organisations. JCU is a site and catalyst for innovation and understanding. Our teaching is high-quality, innovative and engaging to students. Our approach is characterised by personal contact with students and we provide alternate modes of delivery responsive to their needs, in a contemporary learning environment, ensuring contact with teachers and other students. JCU is a contemporary and dynamic institution and a major driver of economic growth and social change in northern Queensland, as well as having international impact and reach. JCU recognises its “power of place” and engages with all its communities and industry to promote a sustainable region that is socially inclusive. As northern Queensland is a site for a first and second roll-out of the National Broadband network, JCU will work with the Government to maximize the opportunities that the NBN presents to reduce the disadvantage of distance and provide opportunities for students to access education and resources.
Our Strategic Intent -
Creating a brighter future for life in the tropics world-wide through graduates and discoveries that make a difference.
Comprehensive, but focused
We are a comprehensive University. Our teaching and research focuses on four themes:
Tropical Ecosystems and Environment
Industries and Economies in the Tropics

Students are at the heart of our University and we inspire them to make a difference in their fields of endeavour and in their communities by:
Delivering high quality teaching and learning programs in a research-rich environment, and
Fostering their professional expertise and intellectual curiosity.
Our world-class research generates new knowledge and understanding to meet the challenges facing the peoples of the tropics.
Diversity and reconciliation
Embracing the diversity of the communities we serve in two countries, we work with them to create opportunities and enduring benefits for our region and beyond.
Acknowledging the First Nation peoples of the world, their rich cultures and their knowledge of the natural environment, we pay particular respect to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, the traditional custodians of the lands and waters of Australia.
We are pledged to achieve genuine and sustainable reconciliation between the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and the wider community.
Sustainability
Committed to the principles of sustainability, we will ensure that our actions today do not limit the range of social, cultural, environmental and economic options open to future generations.
Values and beliefs
Our actions are underpinned by our values and beliefs:
Values
Excellence
Authenticity
Integrity
Sustainability
Mutual Respect
Discovery
Beliefs
We recognise that knowledge has the power to change lives
We ignite and support a passion for learning in our community
We are enriched by and celebrate our communities’ diversity

Since 2011, São Carlos has been officially considered the Brazilian National Capital of Technology, due to its high ratio of doctors per resident: 1:180, while the rest of the country averages 1:5,423. Until 2006, UFSCar was the first and only federal public university in the countryside of the state.
Two years after its foundation, it received the first 96 students, for the undergraduate majors in Sciences – now discontinued – and in Materials Engineering, the first major on this field in Latin America. In that decade, the first three academic centers of the university were instituted: Center of Exact Sciences and Technology, Center of Biological and Health Sciences and Center of Education and Human Sciences.
As the years went by, new departments, undergraduate majors, graduate programs and academic centers were created. All of them have developed activities on teaching-learning, research and public outreach – socially-engaged activities developed and carried out by scholars in order to benefit the external community with the knowledge produced within the university.
The second campus of UFSCar was established in 1991, in the city of Araras, in the Eastern region of state of São Paulo, as a result of the incorporation of regional units of the National Program of Sugar Cane Improvement, a bureau connected to the extinct Institute of Sugar and Alcohol – a Brazilian government agency which mission was guiding, stimulating and controlling the sugar and alcohol production throughout the national territory. The campus is devoted to Agricultural Sciences and features units also in the cities of Anhembi and Valparaiso, both in state of São Paulo.

Early success led to its being named one of the nation’s 64 “key colleges and universities.” In 1975, the school was obliged to move to a new campus in Wuhan. In 1978, the graduate faculties relocated in Beijing under the support of Mr. Deng Xiaoping, the leader of the People’s Republic of China. In 1987, the Ministry of Education approved a plan for China University of Geosciences to develop two tertiary institutions in Beijing and Wuhan respectively, both of which have independent legal personalities. China University of Geosciences in Beijing is among the first group of China’s higher level universities designated for the state key construction of the “211” project and is one of the first 33 universities in China approved to set up graduate schools as well. In February 2000, China University of Geosciences in Beijing (heretofore “CUGB”), previously managed by the Ministry of Land and Resources, was put under the management of the Ministry of Education. In March 2005, CUGB and China University of Geosciences (Wuhan) became independent educational entities. Finally, in September 2006, CUGB was established as a joint responsibility of the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Land and Resources.
Since its foundation in 1952, China University of Geosciences in Beijing has experienced an unusual course of development: creation, expansion, re-location, reconstruction, and revitalization. CUGB has produced a large cohort of graduates equipped with the technical knowledge and professional attitudes needed to build up the nation and contribute to the flourishing of the earth sciences.
At present, the university boasts nine members of the Chinese Academy of Sciences on its staff. Out of 40,000+ graduates, 24 alumni have been elected to either the Chinese Academy of Sciences or the Chinese Academy of Engineering, and more than 200 alumni have been singled out as “model workers” by provinces or ministries.
As a multi-disciplinary national key university, CUGB is one of China’s main centers for educating geological researchers and professionals of all sorts. It has evolved an educational program that balances sciences, technology, arts, management, economics and law—one which emphasizes a connection between education and geology, natural resources, environment and geological engineering. CUGB has 17 colleges with a total of 47 undergraduate programs and 118 graduate programs for a master’s degree, 37 doctoral programs, 16 fields of Master of Engineering, and 9 post-doctoral research stations. At present there are 14,000 full-time students, 25000 continuing education students, 12000 independent college students enrolled with a teaching and research staff comprised of 1200. CUGB is headed by Mr. Wang Hongbing, the chairman of the university council and Prof. Deng Jun, president of the university.
During its 50 years of practice, China University of Geosciences in Beijing has developed its glorious motto of “work hard, keep modest, and pursue truth and pragmatism”.

University of Regina,Canada,Regina,14848.0,uregina.ca,1014,3737 Wascana Parkway,1974.0,"The University of Regina has campuses located in Regina and Saskatoon on Treaty 4 and Treaty 6 territories. These are the ancestral lands of the nêhiyawak, Anihšināpēk, Dakota, Lakota, Nakoda, and the homeland of the Métis/Michif Nation.
A comprehensive university, the U of R traces its roots back to the creation of Regina College, a small residential high school established by the Methodist church in 1911. The College grew in size and significance becoming a campus of the University of Saskatchewan and, ultimately, an independent degree granting university – the University of Regina – in 1974.
The U of R has 10 faculties; 25 academic departments and schools; 10 institutional-level research centres and institutes; and three federated colleges: Campion College, First Nations University of Canada, and Luther College.
In 2022, the University of Regina had nearly 16,000 students. Our tuition rates are on par with the national average and the University is among the top comprehensive universities in the level of student financial support – scholarships, awards, and bursaries – available as a percentage of tuition.
In Regina, our main and historic College Avenue campuses are located on 239 acres in Wascana Park, one of the largest urban parks in North America, providing an attractive study and work environment for our students, faculty and staff. Both campuses are 100 per cent smoke-free as part of our commitment to providing a safe and healthy place in which to study, work, live, and visit.
Our 80,000+ alumni contribute to and build our society in Saskatchewan and in Canada, and are our ambassadors to the world. Our history, accomplishments, and growth as a university stem from our commitment to working together for the good of our local and global communities.
The title of the University of Regina's 2020-2025 Strategic Plan, All Our Relations, is the English equivalent of a phrase familiar to most North American First Nations Peoples. It is often used to formally acknowledge the interconnectedness of family and all their relations including those that walk on two feet, those that walk on four feet, those that swim in the great waters, those that fly in the sky and those that crawl on their bellies.
Through the strategic plan, the University of Regina is committed to five areas of focus and the specific goals related to each: Discovery, Truth and Reconciliation, Well-being and Belonging, Environment and Climate Action, and Impact and Identity.
Discovery lays out the key aspects needed to bolster and strengthen the academic successes and careers of U of R students, faculty, and staff, as well as create impact within communities in Saskatchewan, Canada, and worldwide. It has three overarching objectives – Excellence in Teaching and Research, Student Success, and Internationalization.
We teach and support students to think critically, to engage in ethical reasoning, to understand their worlds and the worlds of others, and to actively contribute to the betterment of society.
A diverse and inclusive environment assists in attracting and retaining teachers and researchers to the University’s faculties and units. It builds on the U of R’s existing areas of national expertise, such as the Child Trauma Research Centre (CTRC), the Canadian Institute for Public Safety and Research Treatment (CIPSRT), the Clean Energy Technology Research Institute (CETRI), and the Institute for Energy, Environment and Sustainable Communities (IEESC), while seeking opportunities for new collaboration with other academics and institutions globally.
With $51.2 million in research revenue in 2021-22, the University of Regina has emerged as a centre of excellence on a number of research fronts. Our four signature research areas are based upon research impact, critical mass of highly qualified personnel, distinctiveness, and commitment to partners in the community and the Province of Saskatchewan.
The University of Regina was named the 2020 Research University of the Year in the undergraduate university category by Research Infosource, a leading source of ranking information on research and development in Canada. Based on six different categories, the designation is awarded to the university that demonstrates superior performance on key measures of research success.
University of Regina graduates experience the best employment outcomes of all post-secondary graduates in Saskatchewan. Leaders in the critical area of experiential learning, our graduates leave our campus prepared to succeed in the world. One of the key strengths of the University of Regina is the growth in enrolment of international students in recent years. In 2021, international students comprised 16 per cent of total students.
Institutional changes at the University—while still ongoing—have made the campus more attractive to Indigenous students that make up 15.7 per cent of the U of R’s student population. This includes initiatives such as the ta-tawâw Student Centre, nitôncipâmin omâ Student Success Program (The OMA Program), Indigenous Social Work and Education programs, the Indigenous Advisory Circle, among others. In June 2021, the University welcomed our first Associate Vice-President (Indigenous Engagement).
Environment and Climate Action – the fourth area of focus in our 2020-25 Strategic Plan – provides a framework for how the University will strengthen its connection with, and protection of, the environment and our climate through three major objectives: reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions; develop the University of Regina as a Living Lab; and decrease the production of waste and consumption of water.
Over the 2009 to 2019 period, the University reduced total electrical consumption by 13 per cent and reduced per square foot electrical consumption by 22 per cent. This accomplishment, alongside our waste, water, and transportation initiatives, led the University to win the 2022 Regina & District Chamber of Commerce Paragon Business Excellence Award for Environmental Excellence.

Over 140 nationalities are represented in the student body.
Nobel Prize winning poet and honorary graduate Seamus Heaney has described the University of Dundee as ""having its head in the clouds and its feet firmly on the ground.""
The ability to be both aspirational and down-to earth, to blend ground-breaking intellectual achievement with practical applications, has given the University its distinctive character.
Today this is seen in excellence in teaching and research and a strong contribution to the social, economic and cultural life of Scotland and the wider world. Dundee is powering forward to become Scotland’s leading university, with a portfolio of learning and teaching, research and impact which is already world-leading in many areas.

University of Graz,Austria,Graz,12551.0,uni-graz.at,639,Universitaetsplatz 3,1585.0,"Situated between the Mediterranean Sea and the Alps, the University of Graz has been a great influence on the character and the life of the capital of Styria (founded in 1585). So far, six Nobel Prize winners have taught and researched as professors at Austria’s second oldest university. Today, these six large faculties define the holistic approach:
Faculty of Theology: The Catholic Theological Faculty is committed to the tradition of the Second Vatican Council. It promotes the dialogue between theology and its cultural, social and political environment by way of research activities and teaching programmes. Its target groups are students in vocational training schemes for church and school professions, adult education, culture and media as well as graduates working in these fields who are interested in further education.
Faculty of Law: Current and basic questions on society and economy are at the centre of research and teaching in Law. The study programme offers a sound basic education and provides students with knowledge and an understanding of law. In traineeships, students are prepared for their demanding jobs at an early stage and they learn a sensitive approach to problems as well as how to apply their knowledge in a competent way.
Faculty of Social and Economic Sciences: The social and economic scientific subjects at the University of Graz are characterised by intellectual independence, critical discussion and cutting-edge research. The trendsetting study programmes are designed to provide answers to practical questions. A comprehensive offer of business languages – among them Russian, Japanese and Chinese – round off the excellent educational programmes.
Faculty of Humanities: The Faculty of Humanities includes about twenty different disciplines. All these individual scientific disciplines have one thing in common – their multifacetted approaches to discussing culture, society and cultural heritage.

BOKU is addressing thecentral challenges faced by society with its expertise in the natural sciencesand engineering, as well as in the social and economic sciences. It isparticularly involved in the following areas:
* Protection anddevelopment of habitats and quality of life
* Management of natural resources and the environment
* Safeguarding nutrition and health
BOKU provides competentanswers for those in academia and politics and partners in the social andeconomic spheres in relation to such pressing issues as climate change,sustainable energy security, food security, use of genetic technology and itseffects, development of sustainable agriculture and forestry and the provisionand promotion of quality of life in urban and rural areas, including in thepresence of migration.
Precisely because ofthe social and political relevance of the issues dealt with, the independenceof the academic research and the associated freedom in terms of choice ofresearch topics and methodologies and publication of results are essential.
Identity, tradition andcontinuity must be maintained and shaped, whilst also making use of theinnovative potential of the members of the university and accelerating itsimplementation. One of the central tasks of the BOKU is to train, on the basisof its own research, a new generation of academics that can contribute in aqualified and critical way to both the technical/scientific andsocioscientific/economic discourse and help to shape future developments.
BOKU is committed topromoting gender equality and the integration of people with special needsbeyond the minimum statutory requirements by creating an appropriate workingenvironment. In general, BOKU is committed to measures that sustainably promoteand improve the well-being, satisfaction and health of the staff and students. Inits research, teaching and service provision, BOKU seeks to perform above theaverage. The quality of work is thus of great importance in all areas. Thequality assurance process is now based on international standards. The understandingof the importance of quality management is demonstrated by its integration intothe institution.
In addition to itsresearch, teaching and service-provision activities, BOKU sees its social rolein the active promotion and development of the values of democracy and the ruleof law. This involves placing particular emphasis on openness to the new,permitting diversity of opinion and actively promoting, both within theuniversity and in the outside world, interaction with other cultures in anon-prejudiced way. BOKU also involves itself in a responsible way in thepublic debate about social problems and their sustainable solutions. In orderto fulfil its tasks, BOKU cooperates with key academic, economic, political andsocial actors both within and outside Austria. With this mission, BOKU lives upto the new role of universities required on the European level in a “Europe ofknowledge”. This covers the full spectrum from knowledge acquisition, knowledgetransfer and dissemination to knowledge application. BOKU seeks to develop and secure Vienna’s andAustria’s positions by increasing its own access and possibilities withinresearch and teaching cooperation.
The unique position ofthe University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences Vienna is a result of itshistorical development: founded as a college of agriculture and forestry, BOKUis today still Austria's only university to deal in depth in its research andteaching with the sustainability and future use of natural resources and ourenvironment. Furthermore, it stands out for its structure, which is problemsolving - rather than subject-orientated. BOKU is thus the only institution inAustria which is in a position to deal comprehensively with entirevalue-creation chains (from production via consumption to disposal).
Fundamental research ata high international level on the one hand and applied work focussing onregional issues on the other secures BOKU's role as the academic backbone ofAustrian primary production, in the widest sense of the term. Industrialisedand developing countries are both very interested in precisely thiscombination, which is demonstrated by the large number of cooperative projects withlocal and international companies, and projects in the field of developmentassistance.
Practical problem-solvingexpertise and excellent connections across Austria are the unique features ofBOKU, and result from its areas of concentration and the uniqueness of thecourses it offers. BOKU is one of the two universities in Austria to drawstudents from very far. This is because of the large number of students fromacross Austria and from abroad – both from developing countries and fromCentral Europe. The close cooperation with its alumni ensures a strongpractical component for BOKU subjects and courses.",,,,48.2,16.366667,https://www.shanghairanking.cn/_uni/logo/a669e9a9f.png
Tulane University,United States,New Orleans,12020.0,tulane.edu,501,6823 Saint Charles Avenue,1834.0,"Since beginning as a medical college in 1834, Tulane has grown into one of the most well-respected research universities in the country. We’re one of just 62 members of the Association of American Universities, an elite group of top-ranked research institutions. Our faculty are involved in projects as diverse as protecting the aquatic resources of the Gulf and chronicling the region’s singular musical heritage. But because of our size – just 8,610 undergrads; classes average 21 students – you won’t be looking at that academic talent from afar. The brilliant faculty who are carrying out that work also happen to be eager, nurturing educators, and they’ll be teaching your classes from the minute you arrive.
There are 1,700 classes to choose from. We offer more than 70 majors in five different schools, including science and engineering, architecture, business, liberal arts and public health. About a third of the students here double major.
Every single one of our undergraduate students, though, gives back. We were the first research university to require community service in the curriculum. Last year alone, our students logged more than 780,000 hours of civic service in New Orleans. (Service is really at our core: The physicians who formed the college that became Tulane were trying to combat epidemics of yellow fever and cholera that ravaged New Orleans in the 19th century.)
Once you spend some time here, it will become clear how Tulane and New Orleans are connected. Tulanians – that’s what we’re known as – come from 58 countries and all 50 states. On average, students travel 923 miles to get here from home. In some places, that kind of diversity sticks out. Here, it blends perfectly with our surroundings. New Orleans is a melting pot of cultures, and our art, architecture, food and music show it.",7667.0,4353.0,1129.0,29.954445,-90.075,https://www.shanghairanking.cn/_uni/logo/9a8c0789e.png

LSE is a specialist university with an international intake and a global reach. Its research and teaching span the full breadth of the social sciences, from economics, politics and law to sociology, anthropology, accounting and finance. LSE was founded in 1895 by four idealistic young members of the Fabian Society for the ""betterment of society"". It adopted as its motto the Latin phrase rerum cognoscere causas, which means to know the causes of things. As of 2015, 16 Nobel Prize winners have studied or taught at LSE.
The desire to bring academic expertise to bear on the problems of society motivated the founders of LSE and underpins the School's vision and strategy today.
The School’s vision is:
· to deliver challenging, stimulating, research led degree programmes in an environment that supports learning and develops independent thinking among our students
· to ensure that its research and teaching remain at the forefront of the social sciences, addressing the evolving challenges of society
· to be among the most internationally-oriented centres of social science excellence in the world and
· to extend its engagement with society across its full academic portfolio and in key regions of the world. This vision for the future is underpinned by three priorities for the School – all of which will be tackled with equal commitment.
Teaching and student experience
Students at LSE receive research-led teaching from an internationally renowned academic staff. At the heart of this is intellectual challenge. Through exposure to the latest developments in social science and to the thinking of visiting world leaders, business figures and academics in debates and public lectures, students are challenged and inspired by LSE's vision of intellectual excellence combined with real-world engagement.
LSE is currently focusing on increasing contact hours between permanent academic staff and undergraduate students; reducing postgraduate class sizes; improving teaching quality; and improving staff and student contact and student satisfaction levels in relation to the academic experience, including Library and IT services. It will also continue to improve its estate, in particular through the opening in 2014 of an exciting new student building.
Research
LSE is a world leader in social science research. The School protects theoretical research and encourages ""blue skies"" research while promoting dynamic engagement with the wider society.
The UK Research Assessment Exercise in 2014 revealed LSE is the top university in the UK based on the proportion of ‘world leading’ (4*) research produced. LSE is also the top university for impact in its social science disciplines, whether judged on Grade Point Average or the proportion of research impact awarded 4*.
LSE is currently focusing on increasing the amount of research funding, especially from peer-reviewed external sources, and improving the quality of research space.
Engagement
LSE is an outward-facing university, constantly engaged with the big policy issues of the day and communities around the world. Its academics are frequently to be found in the media, commenting on issues from the global economy to the government of London. Many serve on government panels and advise international organisations, businesses and charities.

Chartered in 1746, Princeton emphasizes a curriculum that encourages exploration across the disciplines, while providing a core academic experience. Its faculty are known throughout the world and it is not unusual for students to learn from Nobel laureates, Pulitzer Prize winners, and MacArthur fellows. Students benefit from small class sizes and one-on-one advising with faculty, particularly while doing independent work such as the senior thesis. More than 75 percent of student classes have fewer than 20 students. The intellectual endeavors of Princeton's approximately 5,260 undergraduates are supported by a range of first-rate academic resources, from specialized libraries to state-of-the-art laboratories, and even an art museum. In 2017, Princeton opened a new arts center that highlights artistic creativity as a key part of the academic experience. The academic options at Princeton give students flexibility in pursuing their intellectual interests while working toward either the Bachelor of Arts or the Bachelor of Science in Engineering. Students also may earn certificates from among 55 interdisciplinary programs, creating combinations of academic interests. For example, a student might major in physics while also earning a certificate in Latin American studies. Academic pursuits often emphasize civic engagement, such as through the Service Focus program that consists of a funded summer internship and service-related courses. Princeton also encourages students to participate in international learning experiences through study abroad, internships, and summer global seminars.

"Birkbeck, University of London",United Kingdom,London,7742.0,bbk.ac.uk,848,"Malet Street, Bloomsbury",1823.0,"Founded in 1823, Birkbeck, University of London, is one of the world’s leading research universities, with a vibrant, intellectually challenging research culture. Ranked among the top 250 universities worldwide, Birkbeck is proud to be part of the prestigious University of London. That’s important, but what makes us really special is our unique evening teaching and the opportunities this provides to combine study with work. This focused way of learning attracts committed students and academics, and makes studying at Birkbeck intense, enjoyable and life-changing.
Birkbeck has three academic Faculties: Humanities and Social Science; Business and Law; Science. We offer nearly 300 postgraduate taught and research programmes, almost all full-time, mostly evening taught. More than 100 undergraduate degrees are available for full-time evening study over three years, which qualifies them for student visa status. All applications for our full-time evening undergraduate degrees are via UCAS, the UK’s central universities admissions service. Some 10,000 students study with us every year.
Birkbeck's research excellence was confirmed in the most recent assessment of UK research quality, the 2021 Research Excellence Framework (REF), in which 83% of our research was rated ‘world-leading’ or ‘internationally excellent’, placing Birkbeck 46th in the UK for research. Many of our academic staff are renowned world-class experts in their fields, with Biological Science, English and Psychology ranked in the top 20, and Earth Science ranked in the top 10 of UK research.
As well as being leading researchers, our academics are influential thinkers who are deeply involved in the cultural and intellectual life of London, bringing the latest ideas to their teaching. In many universities, star researchers don’t teach undergraduates. At Birkbeck, academics want to spend time in the classroom because we see students as part of our learning community, and believe their varied experience enriches our teaching.
Birkbeck students come from all backgrounds, careers and cultures, and are aged from 18 to 80 plus. Our unique evening teaching gives them the opportunity to combine study at one of the world’s top research-intensive universities with building their future career. Our students may be young people who want to gain workplace experience while they study; working Londoners keen to improve their chance of promotion or change direction in their careers; people who missed out on university education the first time around and have a hunger for learning; or those who just want to follow a passion for their subject.
Facilities offered at Birkbeck include access to a wealth of IT, library and other support services – all of which are geared around evening study. The library is open late, as are the student centre and computing support. Our five-floor library offers more than 400 study places plus a wide range of online resources. Students can also access libraries across London, including the British Library and the University of London’s Senate House Library, right next door to Birkbeck.
Our students come to university primarily to study and improve themselves. But they also enjoy student life and the culture of one of the world’s fastest-moving cities. Birkbeck’s main campus is part of the University of London’s city centre campus, in the heart of academic London in Bloomsbury WC1, just a short walk to the bars, cafes and clubs of Soho and Covent Garden.
While the majority of our students live in private accommodation, we also have places available in University of London intercollegiate halls and an agreement with UNITE, a specialist provider of student accommodation, which entitles full-time Birkbeck students to apply for places within their halls of residence.
We are proud of the diversity of our student community, and welcome applications from international students for our full-time undergraduate programmes and our full-time Master’s or MPhil/PhD degrees. We offer a number of scholarships for international students.

Graduate students’ research is conducted outside of the main Phystech campus, and, therefore, research publications ruttenly are not affiliated to Phystech at all. Such an external labled educational system hides MIPT from the academic radar (that was an advantage during the Cold War).
Structure
Phystech’s unique approach to education and training is supported by well-developed infrastructure that encompasses the main campus and 130 education-research units at major R&D and academic institutions across Moscow and the Moscow region. The university employs (part-time) best sholars to teach at these institutions, located not only in Moscow, but also at national scientific towns (Dubna, Troitsk, Chernogolovka, Fryazino, Pronvino, Puschino, Sarov, etc.).
Phystech degrees
1) Bachelor’s degree programs:
a)Year 1/2 - theoretical studies (100%);
b) Year 3/4 - theory (70%) and practical (30%) based on research institute.
2) Master’s degree programs
a) Year 1/2 – theory (50%) and practical (50%);
b) Year 2/2 – practical (100%) at research institutes (partners of Phystech).
3) PhD degree programs (3-4years full-time study):
a) Practical (70%) and theoretical (30%) research based on collection and analysis of data during the program's duration.
Phystech advantages:
1) Highest applicants score among 1,100 Russian Universities under Russia’s Unified State Exam (USE) – 92 of 100 (USE was introduced by the Ministry of Education to replace high school exited exams. The results of subject tests are used to enter most Russian universities).
2) During the last decade, approximately 1,500 Phystech alumni (25%) moved overseas to get PhD degrees at world-class universities such as MIT, Harvard and Caltech, among others.The Houston space center targets Phystech undergraduate students.
3) In 2009, following a Russian Government initiative to improve the education sector, Phystech obtained a status of the National Research Universityone of 29 universities who are considered to be leaders of the Russian education sector.
4) Fluency in English is typical for students and academic staff which make communication with international partners easy.
5) Phystech professors are ready to share many courses on the free of charge basis, and will allow them to be delivered at partner universities.",,,857.0,55.75222,37.615555,https://www.shanghairanking.cn/_uni/logo-jpg/efea2b6e500.jpg

The origin of Yokohama City University can be traced back to the Yokohama School of Commerce founded in 1882. Since the opening of the port, Yokohama turned into a center of trade in Japan. The Yokohama School of Commerce was established to develop human resources equipped with western commercial techniques and then developed into the Yokohama City College of Commerce (Y college), which is the origin of Yokohama City University. Another origin of YCU is the Juzen Hospital of Nogeyama in 1874. Juzen Hospital then turned into Yokohama Municipal Medical College, which has developed into today’s YCU Hospital and School of Medicine.
YCU became an independent administrative entity in 2005, and has since offered curricula in International Liberal Arts, Economics, Business Administration and Science, as well as in Medicine and Nursing. Now, for the first time in the metropolitan area, YCU has launched a new faculty called ""School of Data Science"" in the spring of 2018 in response to the new social trend and demand to create value from the considerable amount of data our societies generate.

Tokyo Medical and Dental University,Japan,Tokyo,3011.0,tmd.ac.jp,640,1-5-45 Yushima,1928.0,"1. GENERAL
Tokyo Medical and Dental University (TMDU) is the only comprehensive medical university in Japan that has both undergraduate and graduate programs in medicine and dentistry. The undergraduate programs are offered through the Faculty of Medicine and Faculty of Dentistry, and prepare students to be medical and dental professionals. Our graduate programs in Medical and Dental Sciences and Health Sciences produce leaders who go into research (basic research and clinical-based research), education or a combination of such work. Many professors teach and conduct cutting edge research in their respective Faculty or at one of our specialized research institutes, such as the Medical Research Institute or the Institute of Biomaterials and Bioengineering.
2. EDUCATION
Today, approximately 3,000 students are pursuing medical, dental, and life science degrees at TMDU, with a nearly equal number of students in undergraduate and graduate programs. Undergraduates begin their career at the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences to ensure a well-rounded education. After moving on to the Faculty of Medicine or Faculty of Dentistry, students concentrate on a curriculum that is increasingly integrated between medical and dental sciences and utilizes an inter-professional educational approach, just as graduate students at TMDU have traditionally enjoyed.
In the effort to inspire an attitude of intellectual curiosity in its undergraduates, TMDU sends many students to different institutions, such as Imperial College London, King’s College London Dental Institute, and TMDU’s international outreach centers in Ghana, Chile, and Thailand. In addition, TMDU dispatches selected faculty members to Harvard Medical School for the purpose of spurring innovation in curriculum development. In all, TMDU offers over 200 life science degree programs at its two graduate schools. In addition, thousands of patients are treated daily at the attached university hospitals of medicine and dentistry, institutions that further facilitate the school’s educational efforts, basic and clinical research activities, and community service.
Strengthening governance and curriculum quality control to help realize TMDU’s vision for education, the Institute of Education has established in 2016 and assists in the drafting of a consistent university-wide policy that covers all aspects of TMDU’s educational functions, including the selection of applicants for admission, liberal arts education, undergraduate education, graduate school education, and continuing education, and the formulation of a curriculum firmly grounded in that policy. Through a continuous improvement in quality and long-term enhancement of the teaching capabilities of the faculty, the Institute of Education works to ensure that education at TMDU exceeds the international standard.
3. RESEARCH
In April 2017, Institute of Research has been launched for organizing all TMDU research activities. This Institute formulates research strategies at this institution, and supports the implementation of advanced research. By promoting the collection and strategic use of research resources at TMDU and assisting in the creation, protection, and utilization of intellectual property, it facilitates cooperation among government, industry and academia.
Institute of Research has 8 centers to promote specialized research areas and also support and manage diverse research activities in TMDU from various angles. Among them, Bioresource Research Center has advanced facilities to collect and maintain high-quality data and tissue samples from patients at TMDU hospitals with the aim of discovering new causes for disease and developing personalized medicine. Research Center for Industry Alliances literally promotes collaboration between industry and TMDU research. In particular, Medical Innovation Promotion Center supports processes to make the novel knowledge and technology developed at TMDU translated into practical clinical use.
The new Organ and Tissue Neogenesis Consortium was launched in September 2017. It takes as its key concept “moving from regeneration to neogeneration.” Building on the foundation provided by TMDU’s accumulated experience and track record in regenerative medicine, it hopes to create a new paradigm of “neogenerative medicine” that goes beyond regenerative medicine. The consortium aims to build an international center for research on neogenerative medicine by working in concert with public institutions and with researchers and private companies in Japan and overseas. TMDU intends to accelerate efforts to train globally minded young professionals who will play an active role in the work of the consortium, both domestically and internationally.
In 2018, TMDU established a new framework “Open Innovation System“ to expand and accelerate our industry-oriented activities. Above all, it is notable that global companies such as Sony, Yamaha, Hitachi take advantage of the comprehensive open innovation partnership program to develop their business in medical and dental field. In these partnerships and all of its activities, TMDU has one ultimate goal: to serve the needs of patients and their families, in Japan and around the world, by working to fulfill its mission statement of “Cultivating Professionals with Knowledge and Humanity”.
4. INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATION
By strengthening international aspects of the TMDU and, in particular, promoting university-wide globalization in the fields of education, research, and medical treatment, the Institute of Global Affairs has been established in 2016 and aims to assist in achieving TMDU’s goal, as a world-leading integrated medical university under the vision of “Cultivating Professionals with Knowledge and Humanity, thereby Contributing to People’s Well-being”.
TMDU has been selected as an institution to receive support under Top Global University Project which the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) since 2014 to carry out education and research of the global level, which deserves to be ranked in the top 100 universities in the world.
Our concept which was highly appreciated at the time of selection is entitled, “Concept for cultivating human resources that can promote TMDU-type global health: taking on the challenge of improving the level of health on the global scale.” Aiming to improve the level of health on the global scale, Japan—based on its experience and accomplishments in the health care field—will serve a central role in achieving constructive continuance with the world and cultivating human resources that promote global health.
The university’s three overseas research/education centres are also central to its educational and research goals. The Ghana–TMDU Research Center at the Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research at the University of Ghana concentrates on the research of emerging and re-emerging tropical diseases, including malaria, HIV, tuberculosis and neglected tropical diseases. The Latin American Collaborative Research Center in Chile builds on the foundation laid by TMDU, the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and institutions in South America to detect and treat colon cancer at the earliest stage possible. The third centre, the Chulalongkorn University–TMDU Research and Education Collaboration Center in Thailand, facilitates a great deal of cooperation between the two schools, especially in the dental field.
TMDU currently has approximately 370 international students, who are predominantly enrolled in the graduate school. In fact, despite its relatively small size, TMDU has the largest number of international students in the medical and dental fields of any national/public university in Japan. TMDU not only hosts a large number of international students, but also annually sends about 300 students to mainly overseas affiliated universities to broaden and deepen their horisons. TMDU is also recruiting outstanding young scientists from around the world for assistant professorship positions focused on medical science research through its tenure track initiative.
TMDU has established two Joint Degree programs with the University of Chile (Chile) and the Chulalongkorn University (Thiland), and has been cooperatively working and cultivating long-lasting relationsships, to advance the educational philosophy of TMDU “To train medical professionals with a rich international quality”, and to enhance global competitiveness.
Joint Degree is an integrated, international academic program whereby Japanese and foreign universities jointly organize curricula and confer a single academic degree on a person completing the curricula under the names of the presidents of the universities concerned.",1486.0,1525.0,292.0,35.685,139.75139,https://www.shanghairanking.cn/_uni/logo/f08405847.png

Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa,Italy,Pisa,614.0,sns.it,733,Piazza dei Cavalieri 7,1810.0,"The Scuola Normale aims to identify and cultivate the talent and qualities of its students, guaranteeing an education aimed at developing individual potential and abilities, in a context of coexistence, dialogue and collaboration. Dozens of young people are selected each year, through competition, on the sole basis of their talent and their potential. They are housed in colleges and they live and work together: with them, every year the Normale chooses its future, and every day nurtures the latter with an investment that has no equal in Italy or Europe.
The Scuola Normale is above all a community that lives, studies and grows together. Professors, researchers and students live together in a unique environment, where teaching and laboratory activities take place and cultural events and experimental initiatives are developed.
The normalisti and normaliste follow a course of study based on a natural mixture of experiences, research, insights and moments of intuition. From the often unexpected merging of diverse experiences, hopes and talents, a unique educational model has been created, which integrates and harmonises the aptitudes of each individual: individual skills progress in collective sharing.
The model of the Normale is based on certain basic principles: the selection of students exclusively on the basis of merit, study courses and accommodation at absolutely no cost, a strong intertwining of teaching and research, community life and a great openness towards international exchanges.
The teaching syllabus is organized into two courses: the undergraduate course (which corresponds to the three-year degree and the master's degree) and the postgraduate course (PhD). The activity of the Scuola Normale is divided into three Faculties: the Faculty of Letters and Philosophy, the Faculty of Sciences (based in Pisa) and the Faculty of Political and Social Studies (based in Florence).",168.0,446.0,69.0,43.716667,10.383333,https://www.shanghairanking.cn/_uni/logo-jpg/5ed9cf07300.jpg

Rockefeller University,United States,New York,248.0,rockefeller.edu,45,1230 York Avenue,1901.0,"The Rockefeller University is a world-renowned center for research and graduate education in the biomedical sciences, chemistry, bioinformatics, and physics. The university’s over 80 laboratories conduct both clinical and basic research and study a diverse range of biological and biomedical problems with the mission of improving the understanding of life for the benefit of humanity.
Founded in 1901 by John D. Rockefeller, the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research was the country’s first institution devoted exclusively to biomedical research. The Rockefeller University Hospital was founded in 1910 as the first hospital devoted exclusively to clinical research. In the 1950s, the institute expanded its mission to include graduate education and began training new generations of scientists to become research leaders around the world. In 1965, it was renamed The Rockefeller University.
The university is supported by a combination of government and private grants and contracts, private philanthropy and income from the endowment.
Since its founding, The Rockefeller University has embraced an open structure to encourage collaboration between disciplines and empower faculty members to take on high-risk, high-reward projects. No formal departments exist, bureaucracy is kept to a minimum, and scientists are given resources, support, and unparalleled freedom to follow the science wherever it leads.
This unique approach to science has led to some of the world’s most revolutionary contributions to biology and medicine.
For more than 100 years, The Rockefeller Hospital has served as an essential link between laboratory investigation and bedside observation, as patients are participants in clinical studies building on basic research findings from Rockefeller laboratories. This continuous spectrum of research allows for in-depth study of the basis of disease detection, prevention, and observation.
The David Rockefeller Graduate Program is based on the concept of learning science by doing science, and is custom tailored to its individual students and attracts a diverse group of exceptional scientists from around the world. The university also offers one of the nation’s top M.D.-Ph.D. programs with neighboring Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and Weill Cornell Medical College.
In addition to the graduate program, there are other learning/training opportunities available, including postdoctoral research, fellowships for the Center for Studies in Physics and Biology and the Clinical Scholars Program, a master's degree for recent M.D. or M.D.-Ph.D. recipients to begin careers in patient-oriented research.",0.0,248.0,80.0,40.71417,-74.006386,https://www.shanghairanking.cn/_uni/logo/22e351bb0.png

Since1999, the National Higher Education System, hereby NHES, has been fully reformed so as to meet the aims of the ""Bologna process"".
According to the Italian legislation (DM 270/04), the NHES is now organised in 3 cycles: the 1st cycle academic degree is the “Laurea” which grants access to the 2nd cycle academic degree or 1st level university master.
The “Laurea Magistrale”is the main degree of the 2nd cycle. It gives access to 3rd cycle degree programmes resulting either in “Dottorato di Ricerca” (Doctorate research programmes) or in School of Specialization or 2nd level university master.
Hence, the structure of the Italian Higher Education System may be reviewed as follows:
First cycle
bachelor (3 years)
Second cycle
Master’s degree (2 years)
One long cycle degree (5/6 years)
First level vocational Master
Third cycle
research doctorate

External funding raised for research rose between 2007 and 2012 by 77% and currently stands above 53 million Euros per year. The University of Rostock is among the ten most founder - friendly higher education establishments in Germany. The regional economy has benefitted from the over 800 start-up companies launched from the university since 1991. Young people from the West of Germany and increasing numbers of foreign students are discovering Rostock as a study location. Students from more than 90 countries can be found meanwhile on the four campus locations in the city. Since 1991 over 500 million Euros has been invested in the infrastructure of the university. By 2015 it will total 750million.
The University of Rostock is not only the oldest one in the Baltic Sea region but also the richest in tradition. Founded in 1419, it will soon celebrate its 600th anniversary and look back on a long tradition of educating students and doing research. As a comprehensive university, Rostock offers courses of study across nearly all areas: natural and technical sciences, cultural and social sciences, medicine, law, theology and teaching. With over 100 courses of study, 32 bachelor programmes, 43 masters programmes and 41 state exam courses (inc. teaching), the University of Rostock belongs to the higher education establishments in Germany with the broadest spectrum of subjects.
In 2007 the University of Rostock gathered its research capacities into three profile lines. In 2010 a fourth was added. Each profile line commands its own department. Together the four departments form the Interdisciplinary Faculty - a novelty in German university history. From fundamental research, Life, Light & Matter develops new concepts for future technologies based on atomic and molecular processes in connection with laser optics and life sciences. Maritime Systems unites oceanographers, engineers, humanities scholars, agricultural and social scientists, economists and lawyers. They develop scenarios and strategies for the coastal residential and economic area and give answers to complex questions of future civilisation. Successful Aging has as its target a self-determined lifestyle in old age. Forms of medical provision and therapy are researched, particularly with regard to technical assistance systems. The newest profile line, Knowledge - Culture - Transformation, deals with media and the representation of knowledge, transformation of knowledge, knowledge and interculturalism as well as knowledge and power. Highly specialised masters courses benefit from cutting-edge research in the profile lines.",,,,54.083332,12.133333,https://www.shanghairanking.cn/_uni/logo/d936760b9.png

University of Belgrade,Serbia,Belgrade,,bg.ac.rs,420,Studentski trg 1,1808.0,"The University of Belgrade is the oldest and the largest university in Serbia. Its predecessor was a Higher School founded in 1808 that in 1838 became a Lyceum. In 1905, by a special decree of the then Serbian Government, the Lyceum became the University of Belgrade. It started its institutional life with three schools – philosophy, law and engineering. The fact which speaks most about the significance of the University of Belgrade in the Balkans is that all state universities in Serbia and several universities in the region were founded by the University of Belgrade, while private universities in Serbia were founded by the teaching staff educated at the University of Belgrade. Nowadays, the University of Belgrade consists of 31 schools, 11 research institutes, and 8 centers in the fields of vital importance to the functioning of the University, such as: career development, technology transfer, quality assurance, strategic management and planning, work with physically challenged students and Computer Center. The University Library “Svetozar Marković”, with more than 3,500.000 volumes, is also a member of the University. The University disposes of 11 endowments provided by affluent citizens of Serbia and 7 funds for supporting 200 best students of the University of Belgrade. On the occasion of celebrating 200 years of existence of the University of Belgrade and higher education in Serbia, the organization of former students of the University of Belgrade – Alumni of the University of Belgrade – was founded in 2008. Besides connecting former students of the University, this organization aims to contribute to the promotion of quality of studies at the University of Belgrade. The University of Belgrade provides training in traditional and some new emerging disciplines. Its schools are divided into four groups, according to the disciplines they teach: - Sciences and Mathematics- Technology and Engineering Sciences- Medical Sciences- Social Sciences and Humanities. As the largest learning community in this part of Europe, with 432 study programs, of which: 172 undergraduate, 194 master, 66 doctoral studies (with 712 succesfully defended doctoral theses), 94,458 students (of which 4,171 international) and 6,174 academic and research staff, 3,105 papers on SCIE and SSCI lists, numerous publications and scientific and research projects, the University of Belgrade has unique responsibilities and opportunities toward the society. One of its most important roles is to help development of the society through the affirmation and promotion of education and creation of new intellectual partnerships within the University, as well as within the society as a whole. Therefore, it has a very long tradition in academic and cultural exchange, as well as inter-university and international cooperation with universities within the country and abroad. The University of Belgrade has also a great experience in cooperation with international organizations focusing on higher education. This is clearly shown by the bilateral agreements of cooperation concluded with more than 180 universities on every continent, membership in the European University Association (EUA), the Network of Universities from the Capitals of Europe (UNICA), the Black Sea Universities Network (BSUN), the Danube Rectors' Conference (DRC), the University Network of the Adriatic and Ionian Basin (UNIADRION), Association des Universites Francophones (AUF) and others. Students of the University of Belgrade are members of numerous international organizations: Board of European Students of Technology (BEST), Electrical Engineering Students European Association (EESTEC), Association Internationale des Etudiants en Sciences Economiques et Commerciales (AIESEC), European Students of Industrial Engineering and Management (ESTIEM), Association des Etats Généraux des Etudiants de l’Europe (AEGEE), Center for Student International Cooperation (CMSS), European Law Students' Association (ELSA) and South Eastern European Youth Network (SEEYN) and many more. The University also maintains contacts with rectors' conferences in individual countries, with academic associations and teacher and student exchange associations. In addition, the Rector of the University of Belgrade is the President of Conference of Universities of Serbia, which consists of 17 accredited state and private universities. In 2008, the University of Belgrade became an active partner in the ERASMUS MUNDUS cooperation scheme that provides opportunities for academic mobility from the Western Balkans to the EU and vice-versa. The University of Belgrade takes active part in European programs as a grantholder and partner in many projects (Horizon 2020, Erasmus+, TEMPUS, FP7, CIP, LLP, Erasmus Mundus, EUREKA, COST, IPA etc.). Academic Artistic Associations of the University of Belgrade, ‘Branko Krsmanović’ and ‘Španac’, also play an active role in students’ life, helping them express their artistic talents in the area of performing arts. Students of the University of Belgrade are very active in the field of sports. This is illustrated by the fact that they have won numerous medals on Summer and Winter Universiades, and one of them – the 25th Summer Universiade – was hosted by the University of Belgrade. During the two centuries of its existence the University of Belgrade has served its people, and its former students and teachers have greatly contributed towards the development of cultural, scientific, educational, political and economical life of our country. The University of Belgrade is prepared to maintain and improve its position as the leading higher education institution both in the country and in the region. The University is striving to preserve what is worthy in its tradition and what makes it recognizable as a national brand, but has also expressed its readiness to adapt to the challenges of the present day. Having signed the Bologna Declaration, the University of Belgrade has shown its commitment to joining European Higher Education Area in the nearest future.

We remain the number one Australian University for graduate employment outcomes for undergraduate students. We remain number one in not only Indigenous enrolments, but more importantly, Indigenous completions. This means we produce more Indigenous graduates than any other Australian university. We are proud of our students and the impact they are having on their chosen profession. From veterinary surgeon to school teacher – we are delivering the professionals our regional communities need and our regions are stronger for it.
Our research is world class – it is impactful in many ways. It supports communities, industries and global populations. The University’s researchers work in consultation and collaboration with end-users, industry, the professions and communities for the public good. We believe in making a difference and this is evidenced through our research outputs across many disciplines, including agricultural science, horticultural production, food and wine sciences, crop and pasture production, veterinary science, animal production, education, curriculum and pedagogy, environmental science, applied ethics, philosophy, religious studies, criminology, nursing and marketing. In 2018, Australia’s national research evaluation framework, Excellence in Research Australia (ERA), assessed 17 of CSU specific research fields as being at world class or above, with two fields receiving the highest possible ranking. In addition, in the inaugural National Engagement and Impact Assessment in 2018, our research in Biological Sciences, Agricultural and Veterinary Sciences, Studies in Human Society, Indigenous Studies and Studies in Creative Arts and Writing was independently assessed as having high impact, demonstrating the focus we have on achieving impactful research for our communities and industries.
We are a university of the land and people of our regions. Our ethos, a Wiradjuri phrase, yindymarra winhanganha, meaning the wisdom of respectfully knowing how to live well in a world worth living in, embodies our drive to deliver on our objectives of successful graduates and vibrant regional communities while ensuring we develop a strong university built on a capable, agile workforce.
Our four guiding values support our aspirations to be Insightful, Inclusive, Impactful and Inspiring. These values are the principles that guide our decision-making and underpin our ways of working.
